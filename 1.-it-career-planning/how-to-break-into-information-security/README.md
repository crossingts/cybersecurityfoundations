# How to break into information security

## Learning objectives

* Describe three key information security foundation areas
* Understand what is IT infrastructure
* Describe two key information security career routes

This section explains how to break into information security. Demand for information security specialists has soared in the last decade due to increasing rates of cybercrime. The increasing demand for information security analysts and a shortage of talent in the labor market is good news for those ready to seize the moment. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for information security analysts is $102,600, more than double the national median earnings of workers across all industries ($45,760).

But trying to break into information security can seem like an overwhelming endeavor. This section introduces three foundation areas (computer networking, operating systems, and system administration) and two information security career routes (information security analyst and SOC analyst) and offers tips and resources for novices to get started in information security through entry-level security analyst roles.

### A booming labor market <a href="#ember18601" id="ember18601"></a>

There’s never been a better time to get into information security. Worldwide, the cyber workforce shortfall is approximately 3.5 million people. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,

Employment of information security analysts is projected to grow 35 percent from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations. About 19,500 openings for information security analysts are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.

Significant career opportunities exist for Canadians. The Information Communications Technology Council of Canada reports that there will be a need for approximately 50,000 cybersecurity practitioners by 2023, with an additional 100,000 roles for support positions. (EC-Council)

Information security analysts need to develop foundational technical knowledge in the three IT infrastructure foundation areas – networking, operating systems, and system administration – so as to be able to identify, assess, and mitigate information security threats, or to administer and improve the security and capabilities of computer systems.

Beside the technical skills, information security analysts need workplace or soft skills to be able to succeed in their jobs, notably, analytical skills, problem-solving skills, and communication skills. Information security analysts should be detail oriented and have a burning desire to learn new skills and remain informed about emerging cyber threats.

### What is IT infrastructure? <a href="#ember18619" id="ember18619"></a>

When we talk about systems and computer networking, we’re talking about IT infrastructure. The IT infrastructure is comprised of the components required to operate and manage enterprise IT environments. “IT infrastructure can be deployed within a cloud computing system or within an organization’s own facilities” (redhat.com). The components of IT infrastructure include,

hardware, software, networking components, an operating system (OS), and data storage, all of which are used to deliver IT services and solutions. IT infrastructure products are available as downloadable software applications that run on top of existing IT resources—like software-defined storage—or as online solutions offered by service providers—like Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). (redhat.com)

Hardware includes “servers, datacenters, personal computers, routers, switches, and other equipment. The facilities that house, cool, and power a datacenter could also be included as part of the infrastructure” (redhat.com). Software refers to,

the applications used by the business, such as web servers, content management systems, and the OS—like Linux®. The OS is responsible for managing system resources and hardware, and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work. (redhat.com)

Network components “enable network operations, management, and communication between internal and external systems. The network consists of internet connectivity, network enablement, firewalls and security, as well as hardware like routers, switches, and cables” (redhat.com).

IT infrastructure can be traditional or cloud. With traditional infrastructure, the components—like datacenters, data storage, and other equipment—are managed and owned by the business within their own facilities. With cloud infrastructure, the components and resources needed for infrastructure services can be rented from a cloud provider like Alibaba, Amazon, Google, IBM, or Microsoft.

IT infrastructure management is “the coordination of IT resources, systems, platforms, people, and environments” (redhat.com). Common technology infrastructure management types include OS management, Cloud management, Virtualization management, IT operations management, IT automation, Container orchestration, Configuration management, API management, Risk management, and Data management.

### Three information security foundation areas <a href="#ember18609" id="ember18609"></a>

#### Computer networking <a href="#ember18610" id="ember18610"></a>

Key networking topics/skill areas include,

* Network devices (switches, routers, access points, cable modems, etc.)
* The five-layer model (the TCP/IP model) and the seven layers of the OSI model
* Network services like DNS and DHCP
* Cloud computing, everything as a service (XaaS), and cloud storage
* Types of cyber attacks
* Network security solutions, ranging from firewalls to Wifi encryption options

### Two information security career routes <a href="#ember18628" id="ember18628"></a>

You can break into information security as an information security analyst through an enterprise information security analyst role or a security operations center (SOC) analyst role.

#### Information security analyst

Three enterprise information security analyst roles are presented: Vulnerability Assessment Analyst and Penetration Tester, Network/Systems Analyst, and GRC Analyst.

* Vulnerability Assessment Analyst and Penetration Tester/Ethical Hacker

* Network/Systems Analyst

CCNA certification is a great place to start if you choose to focus on network security as your entry point to a career in information security: [How to get CCNA certification](../how-to-get-ccna-certification/).

With this option, the security analyst is likely to be doing a bit of both infrastructure design and optimization tasks as well as risk assessment by security testing tasks.

#### SOC analyst <a href="#ember18641" id="ember18641"></a>

SOC analyst roles are commonly found within Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) and in-house security teams. According to the EY Global Information Security Survey 2018-2019, nearly 6 in 10 financial service providers own a security operations center.

[The Security Operations Center (SOC) career path](../the-security-operations-center-soc-career-path/)

SOC analysts are specialized defensive security professionals, forming the core of the Blue Team. Their primary focus is on monitoring, detecting, investigating, and responding to cyber threats. Key roles within this defensive track include Incident Responder, Forensic Analyst, and Threat Hunter.
