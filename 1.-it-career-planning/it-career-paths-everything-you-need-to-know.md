### Getting into IT

In the absence of a university degree, entry into the IT field can be accomplished through entry level support roles. Holding a bachelor degree (especially in computer science/information systems disciplines) becomes more relevant the more senior is the position. With a four-year degree one should be able to skip entry level support roles and move straight into a junior level role. With the right combination of IT industry certification and lab (hands on) experience gained through completed learning projects and/or demonstrated talent, a university graduate should be able to land an admin/analyst position as their first job in IT. See [Information Technology Career Pathways by MicroTrain Technologies (Chicago, IL)](https://www.microtrain.net/files/career_pathways.pdf).

### Career path: IT Support (Technical Support)

There are 400,000 U.S. job openings in IT and a $52,000 median entry-level salary in IT support, according to U.S. Burning Glass Labor Insight Report (data for 4/01/2021 – 3/31/22).

IT support is all about troubleshooting and problem solving, and providing great customer service along the way. This includes setting up computers for users within an organization, overseeing computer systems, and debugging whenever a problem arises. A job in IT can mean in-person or remote help desk work in a range of organizations across many different industries. (Google IT Support Professional Certificate)

There are generally three tiers or levels of IT support or “tech support” roles that level up to tech support management.
