# Job search strategy

## Learning objectives

* Identify your target job role, industry, and companies
* Analyze your skill gap for the role
* Create a skill development plan
* Tailor and optimize your CV for the role
* Become familiar with the job interview process

When a recruiter has limited time with a decision-maker, they may only highlight one or two resumes—you want yours to be one of them. Below are steps to help you stand out.

## Topics covered in this section

* **Identify your target job role**
* **Identify your target companies**
* **Identify your skill gap**
* **Create a skill bridge plan**
* **Resume optimization**
* **Networking and outreach**
* **Conduct informational interviews**
* **Job interview preparation**
* **Breaking into infosec (newcomers)**

### Identify your target job role

• Determine the income range acceptable for you.

• Identify the job role (job title) that matches your skills, interests, and income requirements.

• Start researching the role's skill/knowledge/credential requirements ASAP!

• Analyze/consider at least 3 job roles. Fill in the following table with the qualifications required for each role and note any gaps between your current skills and the job requirements.

**Job role selection grid (example):**

| **Job title**         | **Skills/qualifications required**                                       | **Skills you have**     | **Skills you need**                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Network Administrator | IP connectivity, IP services, CCNA, Linux                                | Linux, Cisco IOS CLI    | IP connectivity, IP services, CCNA   |
| Incident Responder    | OS (Linux, Windows, Mac), Packet analysis, SIEM tools, CompTIA Security+ | Windows, Mac, Wireshark | Linux, SIEM tools, CompTIA Security+ |
| Penetration Tester    | IT networking, Kali Linux, CEH (EC-Council)                              | IT networking           | Kali Linux, CEH (EC-Council)         |

• Consider how much time you'll need to bridge the skill gap (three months? Six months? Three years?)

### Identify your target companies

• Job applications: Directly (Cisco, Huawei, Apple, etc.) and indirect (recruiters, job boards, job sites, etc.).

• Compile a list of 20+ target companies hiring for your desired role.

• Identify the skills/qualifications expected at these companies for the role.

• Gather background information about the companies - culture, projects, products/services, etc.

• Create a "wishlist" spreadsheet (Company Name, Mission/Vision, Projects, Products/Services, Revenue, Employee Count, Competitors, Headquarter Location, Subsidiaries, etc.).

• Use resources such as Huntr.co to organize your findings.

• Use LLMs/AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc. to research company information.

### Identify your skill gap

• Use the list of 20+ companies to identify the expected skills for the role.

• Research recent job ads (20+ job descriptions) for the role and extract main skills expected for the role.

• Conduct a gap analysis: Identify your skill gap (skills, experience, and certifications you need).

**Skill gap analysis table (example):**

| **Skill/certification**                                                                                                                       | **Required for role** | **Current level** | **Gap/notes**                                                                                                         |

• Decide what you need to learn (your skill gap).

### Create a skill bridge plan

• Create an action plan to address the skill gap (set SMART goals).

• Plan in terms of weeks, months, and years.

• Courses, hands on projects, industry certifications, seminars, etc.

**A three-month action plan (example):**

| **Skill**                               | **Timeline**                                                                                | **Resources\***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Tasks\*\***                                                                                        |

\*Resources: Create a detailed training resources sheet.

\*\*Tasks: Courses, hands on projects, industry certifications, seminars, etc.

**Setting SMART goals:**

• **Specific**: Complete Udemy course: Mastering Active Directory: Administration and Fundamentals.

• **Measurable**: Study 5 hours/week and set up a test environment.

• **Achievable**: Udemy's course is for beginners and is highly rated.

• **Relevant**: Required for target role.

• **Time-bound**: Achieve proficiency within 2 months.

### Resume optimization

• Tailor your resume to the target role.

• Tailor your applications to the target position and target company.

• Optimize your resume for ATS (use resources like Huntr.co).

• Keep the professional summary brief (1–3 lines).

• Submit as a Word document (not PDF) for recruiter edits.

• Use simple formatting—avoid complex columns/fonts.

• Limit length to 2–3 pages, even with extensive experience.

• Roles older than 10 years need only basic details (company, title, dates), or drop.

**ATS compliant resume example:**

### Networking and outreach

• Update and tailor your LinkedIn profile (maybe also your X/Twitter profile).

• Grow your connections (e.g., seven new industry professionals/week from your target companies/industry).

• Create Glassdoor and Indeed profiles.

• Build professional connections (connect, comment, message, etc. industry professionals).

• Schedule informational interviews with connections for information about the job role trends and opportunities.

• Participate in/join webinars, virtual meetups, or networking events to learn about job role trends and opportunities.

### Conduct informational interviews

• Reach out to professionals in your target companies for informational interviews using social media/job hunting platforms (Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, etc.).

• Gain valuable insights into company culture, job requirements, industry trends, organizational structure, etc.

• Use informational interviews to identify any gaps in your resume, skills, or certifications.

### Job interview preparation

• Build a story toolbox:

• People remember stories more than facts.

• Use the STAR method to help structure your stories (where there's "action" or accomplishments to communicate):

* **S - Situation:** Describe the context or problem.
* **T - Task:** Explain your responsibility or role.
* **A - Action:** Detail the actions you took to solve the problem.
* **R - Result:** Explain the outcome/impact you made.

• Prepare at least two stories demonstrating problem-solving skills, interpersonal skills, handling/learning from conflicts and mistakes.

• Responses to common and expected interview questions.

• Practice mock interviews with friends/acquaintances/career coach/yourself.

• Demonstrate cultural/organizational fit (alignment of values, mutual gains).

• Demonstrate your ability to get the job done and add value/make a difference.

• For skills you don't have yet:

• Emphasize (give examples of) your fast learning capabilities.

• Give examples of similar skills/experiences.

• Ask probing/follow-up questions (tailor your responses to their concerns).

• Make a strong first impression:

• Non-verbal communication (body language, tone, posture) plays a huge role—93% of communication is non-verbal.

• First impressions form in a fraction of a second and can be lasting, so present yourself confidently.

• Practice interview answers (responses to common and expected interview questions).

**Common interview questions:**

### Breaking into infosec (newcomers)

Consider:

* Within an organization, transferring to a security role.
* Seeking mentorship from infosec professionals.
* Gaining experience through volunteer work or internships.
* Attending industry conferences (e.g., BSides) and local meetups (ISSA, OWASP, etc.).
* Completing courses, hands on projects, industry certifications.
* Finding a reputable external recruiter.

### Key takeaways

* Start your IT and cybersecurity career by selecting a job role
* Research the industry skills for the role and create a skill development plan
* Tailor your resume for the target role&#x20;
* Start building a professional network ASAP
