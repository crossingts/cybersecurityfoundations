### Confidentiality Attacks and Mitigation Technologies

| Confidentiality Attack                                     | Description & Goal                                                                              | Primary Mitigation Technologies                                                                                             | How the Mitigation Technology Counters the Attack                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Packet Sniffing**                                        | Intercepting and analyzing raw network traffic to steal unencrypted data (e.g., credentials).   | <p><strong>Encryption (TLS)</strong><br><strong>VPN</strong></p>                                                            | **Encryption (TLS)** renders intercepted data useless to the attacker, as it is encrypted and cannot be read without the decryption key.                                    |
| **Port Scanning**                                          | Scanning for open ports to identify vulnerable services for future exploitation.                | <p><strong>Access Controls (Firewalls)</strong><br><strong>Rate Limiting</strong></p>                                       | **Access Controls** via firewalls block unsolicited incoming traffic, closing ports and making systems invisible to scanners.                                               |
| **Wiretapping / MITM**                                     | Secretly monitoring or altering communication between two parties.                              | <p><strong>Encryption (TLS, PGP)</strong><br><strong>Certificate Pinning</strong></p>                                       | **Encryption** ensures that even if communications are intercepted, the content remains confidential and tamper-evident.                                                    |
| **SQL Injection**                                          | Injecting malicious code into a database query to extract unauthorized information.             | <p><strong>Input Validation</strong><br><strong>Prepared Statements</strong><br><strong>Access Controls (RBAC)</strong></p> | **Access Controls (RBAC)** ensures database users have the least privileges necessary, limiting the amount of data that can be exfiltrated even if injection occurs.        |
| **SSL/TLS Stripping**                                      | Forcing a victim's browser to use unencrypted HTTP instead of HTTPS to facilitate interception. | <p><strong>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</strong><br><strong>Encryption (TLS)</strong></p>                          | **HSTS** is a header that forces the browser to strictly use HTTPS, preventing the downgrade to HTTP.                                                                       |
| **Brute-Force Attacks** (implied in port scanning)         | systematically submitting credentials to gain access.                                           | <p><strong>Rate Limiting</strong><br><strong>Access Controls (AAA)</strong></p>                                             | **Rate Limiting** locks an account or introduces delays after a few failed login attempts, making brute-force attacks impractical.                                          |
| **Data Exfiltration** (The result of many attacks)         | The unauthorized transfer of data from a system.                                                | <p><strong>Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</strong><br><strong>Encryption</strong><br><strong>SIEM</strong></p>                  | **DLP** tools monitor and block attempts to send sensitive data outside the network, preventing the success of the attack.                                                  |
| **Privilege Escalation** (often a step in an attack chain) | Gaining higher-level access to view confidential data.                                          | **Access Controls (IAM, RBAC, AAA)**                                                                                        | **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring users and systems can only access the data absolutely necessary for their function. |

#### Key Observations:

* **Encryption is the cornerstone** of protecting data in transit (e.g., from sniffing, wiretapping) and is highly effective against passive interception attacks.
* **Access Controls are fundamental** for protecting data at rest. They form the primary defense against unauthorized access, whether from external attackers or insider threats.
* **DLP and SIEM are reactive/detective controls**. They may not prevent the initial attack vector (like SQLi) but are critical for preventing the final exfiltration of data and alerting security teams.
* **Defense-in-Depth is essential.** No single technology is a silver bullet. For example, mitigating SQL Injection requires **Input Validation** (a process) to stop the attack and **Access Controls (RBAC)** to limit the damage if the attack succeeds.

### Integrity Attacks and Mitigation Technologies

| Integrity Attack                      | Description & Goal                                                                          | Primary Mitigation Technologies                                                                                   | How the Mitigation Technology Counters the Attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Session Hijacking**                 | Taking over a user's active session to perform unauthorized actions or alter data.          | <p><strong>Digital Signatures</strong><br><strong>SIEM + Logging</strong><br><strong>Access Controls</strong></p> | **Digital Signatures** on session tokens or critical transactions can verify their authenticity, preventing an attacker from forging valid requests. **SIEM** can detect anomalous behavior from a hijacked session (e.g., a user performing actions from two different geographic locations at once).                  |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**          | Intercepting and altering communications between two parties.                               | <p><strong>Digital Signatures</strong><br><strong>Hashing (HMAC)</strong></p>                                     | **Digital Signatures** provide non-repudiation and integrity. If a signed message is altered in transit, the signature verification will fail, alerting the recipient to the tampering. **HMAC** can ensure the integrity of a specific message.                                                                        |
| **Data Tampering via Malware**        | Malicious software (e.g., ransomware, rootkits) that corrupts, encrypts, or falsifies data. | <p><strong>Hashing (SHA-256)</strong><br><strong>Backups</strong><br><strong>Version Control</strong></p>         | **Hashing** allows for integrity verification. By comparing a current file hash (e.g., SHA-256) to a known good hash, you can detect any unauthorized changes. **Backups** provide a known-good restore point to recover unaltered data.                                                                                |
| **SQL Injection**                     | Injecting malicious code to modify, delete, or corrupt database records.                    | <p><strong>Input Validation</strong><br><strong>Access Controls (Least Privilege)</strong></p>                    | **Access Controls** applying the principle of least privilege to database accounts can prevent an attack from succeeding. For example, a web application account should not have `DELETE` permissions, limiting the damage of an injection.                                                                             |
| **General Unauthorized Modification** | Any attempt to alter data without permission.                                               | <p><strong>Access Controls (RBAC, Audit Logs)</strong><br><strong>Version Control</strong></p>                    | **Access Controls (Audit Logs)** do not prevent the change but provide a detailed record of **who** made **what** change and **when**, enabling detection, investigation, and reversion. **Version Control** systems like Git allow for easy identification of changes and rolling back to a previous, untainted state. |

#### Key Observations:

* **Detection and Verification are Key:** Unlike confidentiality, which focuses on prevention (encryption), integrity relies heavily on the ability to **detect** changes. Technologies like **Hashing** and **Digital Signatures** are critical for verifying that data has not been altered.
* **Non-Repudiation:** **Digital Signatures** are the strongest control, as they not only verify integrity but also prove the origin of the data, preventing a sender from denying having sent it.
* **The Role of Recovery:** Because integrity attacks aim to corrupt data, **recovery is a core mitigation**. **Backups** and **Version Control** are essential for restoring systems to a known good state.
* **Layered Defense is Critical:** Effective integrity protection uses a combination of:
  * **Preventive** controls (Input Validation, Access Controls) to stop unauthorized changes.
  * **Detective** controls (Hashing, SIEM, Logging) to identify changes that occur.
  * **Corrective** controls (Backups, Version Control) to restore integrity after an attack.

### Availability Attacks and Mitigation Technologies

| Availability Attack                      | Description & Goal                                                                          | Primary Mitigation Technologies                                                                                                   | How the Mitigation Technology Counters the Attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SYN Flood Attack**                     | Exploits the TCP handshake to exhaust server resources, denying new legitimate connections. | <p><strong>DDoS Protection Services</strong><br><strong>Load Balancers</strong></p>                                               | **DDoS Protection Services** (e.g., Cloudflare) automatically detect and filter out malicious SYN flood traffic before it reaches the origin server, absorbing the attack.                                                                                           |
| **ICMP Flood (Ping Flood) Attack**       | Overwhelms a target's network bandwidth with ICMP Echo Requests.                            | <p><strong>DDoS Protection Services</strong><br><strong>Rate Limiting</strong></p>                                                | **Rate Limiting** on network devices can throttle the number of ICMP packets processed per second, preventing the device's CPU from being overwhelmed. **DDoS Protection** scrubs this high-volume traffic in the cloud.                                             |
| **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)** | A large-scale, coordinated attack from a botnet to cripple a target with massive traffic.   | <p><strong>DDoS Protection Services</strong><br><strong>Load Balancers</strong><br><strong>High Availability Systems</strong></p> | **DDoS Protection** is the primary defense, designed to absorb and mitigate multi-vector attacks at the network edge. **High Availability Systems** ensure that if one node fails, others can take over, maintaining service.                                        |
| **Ransomware Attack**                    | Encrypts data to deny access to it, demanding payment for restoration.                      | <p><strong>Immutable Backups</strong><br><strong>SIEM</strong></p>                                                                | **Immutable Backups** are the ultimate defense. They cannot be altered or encrypted by attackers, guaranteeing a clean restore point to recover availability without paying the ransom. **SIEM** can detect the anomalous file encryption activity and alert admins. |
| **Physical Infrastructure Sabotage**     | Physically destroying hardware (servers, cables) to halt operations.                        | <p><strong>High Availability (HA) / Redundancy</strong><br><strong>Backups</strong></p>                                           | **High Availability Systems** with geographically redundant data centers ensure that if one physical location is compromised, another can automatically take over, preventing downtime.                                                                              |

#### Key Observations:

* **Layered Defense (On-Prem vs. Cloud):** Mitigating volumetric attacks (floods, DDoS) requires scaling resources beyond what a single organization can typically handle. **Cloud-based DDoS protection services** are essential as they operate on a massive scale to absorb traffic.
* **The Criticality of Recovery:** For attacks like ransomware that directly destroy data, **recovery is the primary mitigation**. Modern strategies like the **3-2-1 Backup Rule** and especially **immutable backups** are non-negotiable for ensuring availability.
* **Redundancy is Key:** **High Availability (HA)** and **Load Balancers** work together to ensure no single point of failure. If one server is overwhelmed or fails, traffic is distributed to healthy ones, maintaining service continuity.
* **Detection and Prevention:** **SIEM** systems play a crucial role in detecting the early signs of an availability attack (e.g., unusual traffic spikes, rapid file encryption), allowing for a faster response to mitigate impact. **Access Controls (MFA)** prevent attackers from easily gaining the privileged access often needed to deploy ransomware.
