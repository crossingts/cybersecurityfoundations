# Cybersecurity risk management

Risk, threat, vulnerability&#x20;

In addition to the CIA triad, there are some other fundamental security concepts to know.&#x20;

* A vulnerability is any potential weakness that can compromise the CIA of information assets. A window in a house is a vulnerability burglars can exploit to enter the house.&#x20;
* An exploit is something that can potentially be used to exploit the vulnerability. A rock can exploit the weakness of glass windows and may be used to enter a house.
* A threat is the potential of a vulnerability to be exploited. The threat of house burglary is the likelihood a burglar will exploit the glass window vulnerability using a rock (or other exploits) to gain entry into a house.&#x20;
* A mitigation technique is something that can protect against threats. There are various mitigation techniques and they depend on the threat that is being mitigated.

Appropriate mitigation techniques should be implemented everywhere a vulnerability can be exploited, for example, client devices, servers, switches, and routers.&#x20;

Cybersecurity risk management concepts and practices

**How cybersecurity is practiced within organizations**

Organizations take a risk-based approach to information security management.

**Understanding enterprise cybersecurity in terms of risk, threat, vulnerability, and mitigation**

\<In order to simplify data governance, information **should be segregated by levels of importance and risk**, since it is very complicated to safeguard all the data in organization using the same standards … sensitive data has to be protected by more security measures in order to safeguard it. In some cases, in order to archive “defense in depth,” multiple security devices from different vendors are recommended.

**Acceptable risk**

After risk assessment, risks may be accepted, mitigated, or transferred (e.g., to another department or third party better equipped to manage them).

Systems can be more secure or less secure, but there is no absolute security. For example, you can implement malware detection on your network firewall and have the best antivirus software on client PCs, but the chance of the PCs getting infected with malware is never zero.&#x20;

**Security vs functionality**

Yes, data that isn’t accessible to anyone may be perfectly secure, but it’s worthless to the enterprise if it can’t be seen and used.
