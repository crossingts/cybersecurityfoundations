# Cybersecurity risk management

Risk, threat, vulnerability&#x20;

In addition to the CIA triad, there are some other fundamental security concepts to know.&#x20;

* A vulnerability is any potential weakness that can compromise the CIA of information assets. A window in a house is a vulnerability burglars can exploit to enter the house.&#x20;
* An exploit is something that can potentially be used to exploit the vulnerability. A rock can exploit the weakness of glass windows and may be used to enter a house.
* A threat is the potential of a vulnerability to be exploited. The threat of house burglary is the likelihood a burglar will exploit the glass window vulnerability using a rock (or other exploits) to gain entry into a house.&#x20;
* A mitigation technique is something that can protect against threats. There are various mitigation techniques and they depend on the threat that is being mitigated.

Appropriate mitigation techniques should be implemented everywhere a vulnerability can be exploited, for example, client devices, servers, switches, and routers.&#x20;
