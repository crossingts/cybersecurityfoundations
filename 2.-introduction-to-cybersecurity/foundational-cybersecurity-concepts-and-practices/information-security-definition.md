### Information security definition

The terms information security, cybersecurity, Internet security, computer security, and network security have intersecting and evolving meanings, but generally refer to processes of implementing security controls including IA/IT governance frameworks to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of privileged information as well as the technological infrastructure of a computer network or system against unauthorized access or manipulation (Anderson, 2003; Blakley, McDermott & Geer, 2001; Cherdantseva & Hilton, 2013; CNSS, 2010; ISACA, 2008; ISO/IEC 27000:2009; Venter & Eloff, 2003).

Sensitive data should be protected based on the potential impact of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. **Confidentiality** refers to protecting information from being accessed by unauthorized parties. **Integrity** refers to ensuring the authenticity of information—that information is not altered, and that the source of the information is genuine. **Availability** of information means that information is accessible by authorized users.

Information security is “a risk management discipline" (Blakley et al., 2001) focused on identifying information assets, associated risks, and suitable (pragmatic) mitigation methods.

Information security,

* “preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information” (ISO/IEC 27000:2009);
* is concerned with “authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability” (ISO/IEC 27000:2009 sees CIA as properties of information);
* ensures that “only authorized users (confidentiality) have access to accurate and complete information (integrity) when required (availability)” (ISACA, 2008);
* is concerned with both the protection of information as well as the of technological infrastructure or information systems (Cherdantseva & Hilton, 2013; CNSS, 2010);
* is concerned with access to information (CNSS, 201; ISACA, 2008); and
* aims to provide assurance “that information risks and controls are in balance” (Anderson, J., 2003).

Key information security concepts include privacy, authenticity and trustworthiness, non-repudiation, accountability and auditability, and reliability (Cherdantseva & Hilton, 2013; ISO/IEC 27000:2009).&#x20;

The broad pragmatic goal of information security management is to reduce the probability of unauthorized access or damage to valued information assets to an acceptable risk level through risk mitigation strategies that involve management controls (e.g., security policies), technical controls (e.g., intrusion detection techniques), and operational controls (best practices/standard operating procedures).

Information security threats most commonly rated as a concern in higher education in North America are as follows. Confidentiality attacks: Exposure of confidential or sensitive information (79%), Integrity attacks: Unauthorized or accidental modification of data (29%), Availability attacks: Loss of availability or sabotage of systems (16%), mixed threat attacks: Email viruses, ransomware, or other malware (31%), and Unauthorized, malicious network/system access (27%) (EDUCAUSE Information Security Almanac, April 2019, p. 2).

### The place of information security in enterprise IT governance

Information security governance is the top-level enterprise business function accountable for information security under the rubric of IT governance (NCC 2005 IT Governance). The IT department is a customer of the information security governance business function or service, (e.g., HR, Finance).&#x20;

IT security as integrated with enterprise-wide risk management policy/framework (IT security risk management) operates within the information security governance framework. Information security is a specialized function within business organizations focused on securing an organization’s information assets against unauthorized access or damage. An information security professional from IT ensures an institution’s IT system is operating in a way that meets varied regulatory requirements.&#x20;

IT security is a stakeholder level concern within enterprises and is concerned with Internet access and identity and access management, and the technological infrastructure of the IT network and its smooth operation. Information security governance is concerned with defining security policy and aligning security strategy with business strategy. Information Systems are comprised of hardware, software, and communications “with the purpose to help identify and apply information security industry standards, as mechanisms of protection and prevention, at three levels or layers: Physical, personal and organizational” (Cherdantseva & Hilton, 2013).&#x20;

Areas for which central IT most commonly has primary responsibility in higher education are Network security (94%), Monitoring (88%), Communications security (86%), and Identity management (83%) (EDUCAUSE Information Security Almanac, April 2019).
