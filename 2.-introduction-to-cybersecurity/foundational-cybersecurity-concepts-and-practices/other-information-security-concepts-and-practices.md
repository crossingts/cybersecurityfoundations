# Other cybersecurity concepts and practices

**The AAA framework**&#x20;

AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. It’s a framework for controlling and monitoring users of a computer system, such as a network.

**The primary goals of cryptography**

The primary goals of cryptography are confidentiality, authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation.

• Confidentiality is the property that keeps information secret/non-available to unauthorized parties. \
• Authentication relates to the identification of a user and data; in other words, it is a process of confirming that the data and user are genuine. \
• Data integrity is related to ensuring that information is not changed or manipulated by unauthorized parties. The focus in on verifying that that the data or message that you’ve received is genuine and hasn’t been altered by an unauthorized third party.\
• Non-repudiation prevents a user from denying authorship of actions and information they’ve made. For instance, a friend of yours may promise to join your team in Pokémon Go, then refuse to admit they’d made that promise. To resolve that type of situation, there should be a trusted third party (say, some mutual friend) who will keep track of everybody’s commitments.>

#### Essential cryptography terms&#x20;

<**Encryption** is a process of transforming simple text/data, called plaintext, into unintelligible form, named as ciphertext. Decryption is the inverse process of encryption. **Cipher** is an algorithm that performs encryption/decryption. A **key** is a secret string of characters or symbols that is used for the encryption/decryption of plaintext/ciphertext. Sometimes, the term **cryptosystem** is used instead of cipher. There are two types of ciphers depending on the use of keys: symmetric and asymmetric.\
**Symmetric ciphers**, also referred as secret-key ciphers, use the same key for encryption and decryption. Symmetric cryptosystems are divided into two groups: block and stream ciphers. In block ciphers, operations of encryption/decryption are performed on blocks of bits or bytes, whereas stream ciphers operate on individual bits/bytes. **Asymmetric ciphers**, alternatively named public-key ciphers, use two keys, one for encryption and other for decryption. **Cryptanalysis** is a study of techniques for “cracking” encryption ciphers, i.e., attacks on cryptosystems. And chances are you’ve heard about **hashing algorithms**, which involves taking an input of any length and outputting a fixed-length string, called a hash. Which can be used, for example, as signatures or for data-integrity purposes.>
