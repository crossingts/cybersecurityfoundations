# Risk mitigation methods

## Learning objectives

• Point 1\
• Point 2 \
• Point 3\
• Point 4 \
• Point 5

Risk mitigation methods reduce the risk of a security breach or minimize the impact of an attack if it occurs.

Risk mitigation methods spanning **technologies** (firewalls, IDS/IPS, encryption, VPN), **network design** (segmentation, DMZ, and honeypots), **networking protocols** (don't use DTP/VTP; use encryption protocols), **organizational policies** (e.g., usage policy, security policy, privacy policy), **compliance frameworks, risk assessment/security testing, professional conduct, and security training.**

## Topics covered in this section

* **Risk mitigation technologies**
* **Risk mitigation via (re)design**
* **Networking protocols**
* **Organizational policies**
* **Compliance frameworks**
* **Risk assessment/security testing**
* **Professional conduct**
* **Security training**

### Risk mitigation technologies

Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Next-Gen Firewalls, Encryption, VPN, SIEM, EDR/XDR, Web Proxies, Network Access Control, Anti-Virus

Common mitigation techniques include:

• Firewalls: Network security systems that control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

• Access Control Lists (ACLs): Configuring network devices to only allow specific traffic to pass through based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

• Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Network-based systems that monitor network traffic for signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity.

• Encryption: Converting plaintext data into unreadable ciphertext to protect it from unauthorized access.

• Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Creating a secure, encrypted connection between two or more networks over the Internet.

### Risk mitigation via (re)design

Segmentation, DMZ, Honeypots, Defense in Depth

### Networking protocols&#x20;

IPsec/GRE over IPsec, Encryption protocols/IEEE 802.11, DTP/VTP

Vulnerable protocols that transmit data in plaintext (e.g., FTP, SNMP v1/v2c community strings, Telnet passwords). Credentials and configuration data can be exposed to anyone on the network.

Network Address Translation (NAT): Hiding internal IP addresses from the public Internet by translating them to a public IP address.

### Organizational policies&#x20;

Usage policy, Security policy, Privacy policy

**An information security policy covering:**

* Software development and testing/software security
* Network design and testing/network security
* Hardware security policy
* Standard operating procedures/information command and control policy
* Ethical code of conduct
* Security awareness training
* User responsibility/usage policies (AUP)
* Information security risk governance (cybersecurity regulations and IT governance compliance frameworks)
* Backup and disaster recovery

An organization’s information security policy has to be clear—and regularly updated. Employee’s knowledge of and adherence to information security policy are critical to robust data security.

### Compliance frameworks

### Risk assessment/security testing

Information security testing is performed in risk assessments and compliance audits. In fact, it is an essential part of both processes.

• Risk assessment: Information security testing is used to identify and assess the risks to an organization's information assets. This information is then used to develop and implement security controls to mitigate those risks.&#x20;

• Compliance audits: Information security testing is used to verify that an organization's information security controls are effective and are in compliance with applicable regulations.&#x20;

There are a variety of information security testing methods that can be used, including:

• Vulnerability scanning: This method scans an organization's systems and networks for known vulnerabilities.&#x20;

• Penetration testing: This method simulates an attack on an organization's systems and networks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.&#x20;

• Social engineering testing: This method tests the effectiveness of an organization's security controls against social engineering attacks.&#x20;

• Physical security testing: This method tests the security of an organization's physical assets, such as its buildings and data centers.&#x20;

The specific information security testing methods that are used will vary depending on the organization's specific risk assessment and compliance requirements.

Some of the benefits of information security testing include:

• It helps to identify and assess risks to an organization's information assets.&#x20;

• It helps to verify that an organization's information security controls are effective and are in compliance with applicable regulations.&#x20;

• It helps to identify and fix security vulnerabilities before they are exploited by attackers.&#x20;

• It helps to improve an organization's overall security posture.

### Professional conduct

### Security training

As technology evolves, so do the tactics of attackers, making continuous learning and adaptation paramount in maintaining robust cybersecurity defenses.

In order to have great data security, it is important to maintain security awareness among employees. Good security awareness among IT personnel and other employees will allow your enterprise’s technical controls to work effectively. Employees should receive continuous security education.
