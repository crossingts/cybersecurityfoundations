### Cybersecurity threats at the social and individual levels

**Societal level threats**

Cyberwarfare/cyberattacks on critical infrastructure such as the power grid, defence facilities, and health services: “As the number and variety of devices used to support, monitor, and control critical infrastructure become more interconnected, the likelihood of cyber threat actors disrupting critical infrastructure has increased” (CSE, 2018, p. 23).

Cyberwarfare/cyberattacks on public institutions and sensitive information: Cyber threat activity “against public institutions—such as government departments, universities, and hospitals—is likely to persist because of the essential nature of the services and the sensitivity of the information they manage” (CSE, 2018, p. 26).

Cyberwarfare: Targeted propaganda/misinformation/disinformation via social media platforms (e.g., to foment unrest/public discord against authorities/government).&#x20;

**Individual level threats**

Cybercrime (personal information/identity theft): Canadians face a rising cyber risk of falling victim to cybercrime, especially identity theft. Theft of personal and financial information is lucrative for cybercriminals and is very likely to increase (CSE, 2018). Cybercriminals profit "by obtaining account login credentials, credit card details, and other personal information. They exploit this information to directly steal money, to resell information on cybercrime marketplaces, to commit fraud, or for extortion" (CSE, 2018, p. 11).

Political interference/cyber warfare (malicious online influence activity): Cyber threat actors can amplify or suppress social media content using botnets, which automate online interactions and share content with unsuspecting users (CSE, 2018). By spreading their preferred content among large numbers of paid and legitimate users, cyber threat actors can promote their specific point of view and potentially influence Canadians. (CSE, 2018, p. 15)

State and business surveillance: Cases in point are NSA's dragnet surveillance program, and Facebook’s Cambridge-Analytica data scandal.

### Cybersecurity threats to business/industry

Businesses face an increasing risk of cybercrime, especially data breaches from commercial espionage, commercial data theft, and social engineering schemes (social engineering often combined with malware/ransomeware or phishing attacks).

**Cybercrime (data breaches)**

“Canadian businesses, especially those active in strategic sectors of the economy, are subject to cyber espionage aimed at stealing intellectual property and other commercially sensitive information.” This cyber threat activity “can harm Canada’s competitive business advantage and undermine our strategic position in global markets” (CSE, 2018, p. 19).

“Foreign and domestic adversaries target higher education institutions that have military and government contracts” (McNamara March 15, 2019).

**Political interference/cyberwarfare**

Cyber warfare can involve sabotage (e.g., Stuxnet attributed to the United States and Israel); Malware attacks on financial institutions (e.g., WannaCry and Petya ransomware attributed to North Korea).

**Surveillance**

Business surveillance: Innovation vs Privacy (the "duet of century").

Espionage/information theft: Cyber campaigns launched by hackers from one country targeting firms of another country resulting in the theft of business information “such as bid prices, contracts and information related to mergers and acquisitions” (Onag, 2018).

#### Risk in higher education (industry in focus)

According to EDUCAUSE, a U.S. based nonprofit association that helps higher education elevate the impact of IT, with community of over 100,000 members spanning 45 countries, information security was the number one IT governance issue in 2016. The top higher education information security **risks** that were a priority for IT in 2016 were 1) phishing and social engineering; 2) end-user awareness, training, and education; 3) limited resources for the information security program (i.e., too much work and not enough time or people); and 4) addressing regulatory requirements (Grama & Vogel, 2017).

The top higher education information security risks in the U.S. and Canada that are a priority for IT in 2016 (Grama & Vogel, 2017) are summarized as follows.

**Information Security Risk in Higher Education (Adapted from EDUCAUSE, 2019)**

| Risk                                                        | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1) Phishing and Social Engineering                          | “Over the past two decades, phishing scams have become more sophisticated and harder to detect.” While traditional phishing messages “sought access to an end user’s institutional access credentials (e.g., username and password),” today “ransomware and threats of extortion are common in phishing messages, leaving end users to wonder if they have to actually pay the ransom.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2) End-User Awareness, Training, and Education              | End-user awareness, training, and education “is critical as campuses combat persistent threats and try to make faculty, students, and staff more aware of the current risks.” While “the majority of U.S. institutions (74%) require information security training for faculty and staff, those programs tend to be leanly staffed with small budgets.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3) Limited Resources for the Information Security Program   | The 2015 EDUCAUSE Core Data Service survey covering all US higher education institutions showed that about 2 percent of total central IT spending is allocated for information security and that there is 0.1 central IT information security FTEs per 1,000 institutional FTEs (full time equivalents). About 55% of surveyed respondents said the security awareness budget for 2016 was less than 5K; and about 25% said they do not know; 15% said between 5-25k; and 7% said between 25-50k; and less than 1% said between 50 and 100K. “With limited resources, higher education institutions must be creative and collaborative in addressing information security awareness needs.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 4) Addressing Regulatory Requirements                       | The regulatory environment impacting higher education IT systems is complex. Data protection in higher education IT systems is governed by a patchwork of different federal and/or state laws rather than by one national data protection law.   Student data are traditionally protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) “although some types of student data, when it is held in healthcare IT systems, may be protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).”   In addition, some types of student and institutional employee financial data may be protected by the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA). State laws may have data-breach notification requirements, and contractual agreements may have their own list of security technological controls that must be implemented and validated in IT systems.

### Technological drivers of change

• Digital convergence of communications and telecommunication/broadcast industries

• AI/ML

• Internet of things (IoT)

• A growing spyware industry

### Sociopolitical drivers of change

• Social digitization

• U.S. - China competition for technological and geopolitical dominance

• Concentration of media ownership (privacy vs innovation)

• Expansion of the military-industrial complex (collusion between Western governments and the dominant media companies)

#### Social digitization

Kool, Timmer, Royakkers, and van Est (2017) of the Dutch Rathenau Instituut argue that the digitization of society has entered a cybernetic phase, thanks to a host of emergent technological innovations in computing and communications together generating a new wave of digitization. The concept of digitization refers to a large cluster of digital technologies such as robotics, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and algorithms, and big data. Artificial intelligence is becoming ubiquitous, increasingly finding its way into more and more software applications, and involves giving computer systems a form of intelligence, such as learning and autonomous decision making, and thus supports a myriad of emerging and disruptive technological innovations (e.g., smart environments, robotics, and network monitoring). “Urgent Upgrade: Protect Public Values in Our Digitized Society” explores the ethical and societal challenges of digitization and the challenges of the governance landscape in the Netherlands. “We investigated which technologies are expected to shape digital society in the coming years, and which social and ethical challenges they will bring” (p. 116). The analysis involved an examination of the role of the scientific community and knowledge institutions, institutions responsible for protecting human rights, civil society, and “the roles of policy makers and politicians in agenda setting, in political decision making, and in the implementation of policy” (p. 11).

The analysis investigated the ethical and social issues that arise in the material, biological, socio-cultural and digital worlds and focused on eight technology areas that “best illustrate a wide range of the impact of the new wave of digitization” (p. 23)--that is, IoT and robotics; biometrics and persuasive technology; digital platforms, augmented reality, virtual reality and social media; and artificial intelligence, algorithms and big data (see Table 2).

Although “digitization has been going on for decades,” recently it has become “easier to intervene real time in the physical world at an increasingly detailed level.” This “ushered in a new phase in the development of the digital society; a phase in which a cybernetic loop exists between the physical and the digital world” (p. 44). This means,

_processes in the physical world are measured, the resulting data is analysed, and then real time intervention takes place based on that data analysis. The impact of the intervention can subsequently be measured, analysed and adjusted, before rejoining the following cybernetic loop cycle. (p. 44)_

Kool et al. (2017) see “a return to the so-called ‘cybernetic thinking’ that attracted interest in the 1950s and 1960s.” In cybernetics “biological, social and cognitive processes can be understood in terms of information processes and systems, and thus digitally programmed and controlled” (p. 44). Based on the various phases in the cybernetic loop--collection, analysis, and application--the authors “see various ethical and social issues emerging” related to the development of technology that require attention in the coming years. The new wave of digitization is “leading to a world in which continuous feedback and realtime management and control are increasingly important principles for a range of services.” This exerts “a strain on important public values” such as privacy, equity and equality, autonomy and human dignity. These values are clustered into seven topics (see Table 3: Overview of Ethical and Societal Issues Related to Digitization). Analysis of the scientific literature on technologies revealed several recurring themes – “privacy, autonomy, security, controlling technology, human dignity, equity and inequality, and power relations” (Kool et al., 2017, p. 47).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Table 3: Overview of Ethical and Societal Issues Related to Digitization (Kool et al., 2017, p. 8)</p></figcaption></figure>

Kool et al. (2017) argue that while initially digitization processes consisted of “the large-scale collection of data on the physical, biological and social world,” a new wave of digitization characterized by continuous, cybernetic, feedback loops is focused on the large-scale analysis and application of that data. Nowadays “we can analyse this data on a large scale and apply the acquired knowledge directly in the real world” (p. 43). On one hand, real-time intervention and cybernetic (re)directing can be beneficial to society in various sectors--e.g., self-driving cars that update their digital maps through experience (learning). On the other hand, “Take for example social media users’ newsfeeds, which social media companies are now ‘customizing’ based on their monitoring and analysis of these same users’ surfing behaviour” (Kool et al., 2017, p. 25). Surveillance capitalism “commodifies personal clicking behavior” -- “it unilaterally claims private human experience as a free source of raw material” (Thompson, 2019). Social media sites are “calibrated” for user engagement and interaction. Surveillance can influence user behavior in complex ways, including unconsciously--hitting either the information security or the political autonomy of citizens. Data surveillance “can unconsciously influence a user’s identity, and lead to ‘filter bubbles’, in which the system only suggests news, information and contacts that match the user’s previous behaviour, choices and interests” (Kool et al., 2017, p. 10).

Kool et al. (2017) conclude that “the far-reaching digitization of society is raising fundamental ethical and societal issues.” Government and society “are not adequately equipped to deal with these issues” (p. 26). The governance system “needs to be upgraded if it is to “safeguard our public values and fundamental rights in the digital age now and in the future.” This upgrading “requires that all parties – government, business and civil society – take action to keep digitization on the right track” (p. 26).
