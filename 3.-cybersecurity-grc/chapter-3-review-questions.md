# Chapter 3 review questions

### Key cybersecurity regulations and standards

**1. Define the difference between a cybersecurity regulation and an industry standard, and provide an example of each.**\
**Answer:**\
A cybersecurity regulation is a statutory law created and enforced by a governmental body. Compliance is mandatory, and non-compliance results in legal penalties. Example: The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). An industry standard is a framework or set of controls developed by industry groups or standards bodies. Its authority is contractual or voluntary, becoming binding when included in an agreement. Example: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

**2. Explain the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and describe one of its key principles.**\
**Answer:**\
The GDPR is a comprehensive EU data privacy law designed to protect the personal data and privacy of individuals in the European Union. Its purpose is to give individuals control over their personal data and to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe. One of its seven key principles is purpose limitation, which means personal data can only be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.

**3. Describe the primary goal of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and list its six core functions.**\
**Answer:**\
The primary goal of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is to provide a voluntary, risk-based framework to help organizations manage and reduce their cybersecurity risk. It helps organizations align their security activities with business needs, risk tolerances, and resources. Its six core functions are: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

**4. Explain what a SOC 2 Type II report assesses and who its primary intended audience is.**\
**Answer:**\
A SOC 2 Type II report assesses the operational effectiveness of a service organization's controls over a specified period of time, typically 6 to 12 months. It evaluates whether the controls are not only suitably designed but also functioning correctly over that period. Its primary intended audience is the organization's management, existing clients, and prospective clients, who receive the detailed report under a non-disclosure agreement.

**5. Describe the tiered structure of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 and what each level is designed to protect.**\
**Answer:**\
CMMC 2.0 has a three-level tiered structure. Level 1 (Foundational) is designed to protect Federal Contract Information (FCI) and requires 17 basic practices. Level 2 (Advanced) is designed to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and aligns with the 110 security controls from NIST SP 800-171. Level 3 (Expert) is designed to protect CUI within high-priority programs and adds controls from NIST SP 800-172 to defend against advanced persistent threats.

### The GRC approach to cybersecurity management

**1. Define the three core components of the integrated GRC model and describe the primary focus of each.**\
**Answer:**\
The three core components are Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance. Governance focuses on establishing strategic direction, policies, and oversight to align cybersecurity with business objectives. Risk Management focuses on identifying, assessing, treating, and monitoring cybersecurity risks within the organization's risk appetite. Compliance focuses on validating that security controls and practices meet legal, regulatory, and internal policy obligations.

**2. Explain the primary purpose of the GOVERN (GV) Function in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 and name one of its key Categories.**\
**Answer:**\
The primary purpose of the GOVERN (GV) Function is to establish, communicate, and monitor the strategy, policy, and oversight mechanisms that inform how an organization makes and executes its cybersecurity risk management decisions. It serves as the foundation for all other CSF functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). One of its key Categories is Risk Management Strategy (GV.RM), which involves establishing and communicating the organization's cybersecurity risk appetite and tolerance.

**3. Describe the four common options for treating a cybersecurity risk identified during the risk management process.**\
**Answer:**\
The four common treatment options are Mitigate, Accept, Avoid, and Transfer. Mitigate involves implementing security controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk. Accept is the conscious decision to take no action after determining the risk falls within the organization's established risk appetite. Avoid entails eliminating the risk entirely by discontinuing the risky activity. Transfer shifts the financial burden of the risk to a third party, typically through cybersecurity insurance.

**4. List the five typical steps in a formal compliance audit process and describe one key activity in the first step.**\
**Answer:**\
The five typical steps are: 1) Planning & Scoping, 2) Evidence Collection, 3) Evaluation & Testing, 4) Reporting & Documentation, and 5) Management Response & Follow-up. A key activity in the first step (Planning & Scoping) is defining the audit objective, scope, and criteria, which involves identifying the specific regulations, systems, and controls to be evaluated (e.g., "Audit access controls against PCI DSS Requirement 8").

**5. Distinguish between a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) and a Key Risk Indicator (KRI) in the context of GRC program measurement, and provide an example of each.**\
**Answer:**\
A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) measures the performance and efficiency of security processes and controls, indicating how well GRC activities are being executed. An example is the mean time to patch critical vulnerabilities. A Key Risk Indicator (KRI) is a forward-looking metric that measures changes in the organization's risk exposure, serving as an early warning signal. An example is the number of high-risk vulnerabilities exceeding the remediation SLA.
