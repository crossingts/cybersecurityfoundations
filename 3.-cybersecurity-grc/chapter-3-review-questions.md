### Key cybersecurity regulations and standards

**1. Define the difference between a cybersecurity regulation and an industry standard, and provide an example of each.**\
**Answer:**\
A cybersecurity regulation is a statutory law created and enforced by a governmental body. Compliance is mandatory, and non-compliance results in legal penalties. Example: The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). An industry standard is a framework or set of controls developed by industry groups or standards bodies. Its authority is contractual or voluntary, becoming binding when included in an agreement. Example: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

**2. Explain the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and describe one of its key principles.**\
**Answer:**\
The GDPR is a comprehensive EU data privacy law designed to protect the personal data and privacy of individuals in the European Union. Its purpose is to give individuals control over their personal data and to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe. One of its seven key principles is purpose limitation, which means personal data can only be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.

**3. Describe the primary goal of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and list its six core functions.**\
**Answer:**\
The primary goal of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is to provide a voluntary, risk-based framework to help organizations manage and reduce their cybersecurity risk. It helps organizations align their security activities with business needs, risk tolerances, and resources. Its six core functions are: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

**4. Explain what a SOC 2 Type II report assesses and who its primary intended audience is.**\
**Answer:**\
A SOC 2 Type II report assesses the operational effectiveness of a service organization's controls over a specified period of time, typically 6 to 12 months. It evaluates whether the controls are not only suitably designed but also functioning correctly over that period. Its primary intended audience is the organization's management, existing clients, and prospective clients, who receive the detailed report under a non-disclosure agreement.

**5. Describe the tiered structure of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 and what each level is designed to protect.**\
**Answer:**\
CMMC 2.0 has a three-level tiered structure. Level 1 (Foundational) is designed to protect Federal Contract Information (FCI) and requires 17 basic practices. Level 2 (Advanced) is designed to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and aligns with the 110 security controls from NIST SP 800-171. Level 3 (Expert) is designed to protect CUI within high-priority programs and adds controls from NIST SP 800-172 to defend against advanced persistent threats.
