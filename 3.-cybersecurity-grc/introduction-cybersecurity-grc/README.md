# Introduction - Cybersecurity GRC

## Chapter 3: Cybersecurity GRC

This chapter explores how organizations integrate cybersecurity into enterprise risk management through Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) frameworks. Students will learn how regulations, standards, and risk assessment methodologies align with business objectives to mitigate cyber risks.

**This chapter will help students:**

* Understand the strategic, ethical, and legal importance of cybersecurity regulations and standards for businesses.
* Define the concepts of Governance, Risk, and Compliance, and explain their role in IT governance.
* Understand information security risk assessment phases and terminology.
* Identify key cybersecurity regulations (e.g., GGDPR, HIPAA, and SOX) and industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS).
* Understand how GRC can be used as a cybersecurity risk management framework (RMF).
* Become familiar with popular information security RMFs, including NIST SP 800-37, NIST CSF, and ISO/IEC 27001, and how they can be combined.
