### Comparing TCP to UDP

#### 1. Which characteristic best describes why TCP is considered a stateful protocol? (Choose one answer)

a) It uses a checksum to detect errors in the data

**b) It tracks the state of the communication session through handshakes and sequence numbers**

c) It can operate over both IPv4 and IPv6 networks

d) It uses port numbers to direct data to the correct application

#### 2. A cybersecurity analyst notices network traffic using destination port 53. Which protocol and service are most likely being used? (Choose one answer)

a) TCP and HTTPS

**b) UDP and DNS**

c) TCP and SSH

d) UDP and SMTP

#### 3. What is the primary advantage UDP has over TCP? (Choose one answer)

a) Stronger error correction and data recovery features

b) Guaranteed, in-order delivery of all data packets

**c) Lower latency and reduced protocol overhead**

d) Built-in encryption for securing data in transit

#### 4. During the TCP three-way handshake, what is the purpose of the second segment (SYN-ACK)? (Choose one answer)

a) It acknowledges the first segment and terminates the connection

**b) It acknowledges the first segment and simultaneously initiates its own connection request**

c) It contains the initial data payload for the session

d) It is a retransmission of the first segment to ensure reliability

#### 5. A network engineer discovers that a real-time video conferencing application is incorrectly configured to use TCP instead of UDP. Which characteristic of TCP is most directly responsible for the latency and lag the users are experiencing? (Choose one answer)

a) Its use of port numbers for session multiplexing

b) Its connection-oriented nature requiring a three-way handshake

**c) Its mechanisms for reliability, including acknowledgments and retransmissions**

d) Its large header size compared to UDP
