# Introduction - Networking fundamentals

## Chapter 4: Networking fundamentals

This chapter has two main goals. First, this chapter demystifies the underlying framework that makes networking possible. You will explore the core hardware, theoretical models like OSI, and essential protocols that work in concert to move data across a network. This knowledge culminates in a complete understanding of the journey a simple web request takes, tracing each step from the moment you type "www.google.com" into your browser until the page appears on your screen. Second, this chapter establishes the essential groundwork for building and securing a functional network. You will develop the necessary skills to configure and verify a router's core operational services, from implementing device security and establishing static routes to controlling traffic with ACLs. Furthermore, you will learn to integrate fundamental network services by configuring DHCP for dynamic addressing, DNS for name resolution, and NAT for internet connectivity, providing a comprehensive toolkit for modern network management.

**This chapter will help students:**

• Map networking protocols and devices to their functions and OSI model layers.

• Identify common networking protocols involved in data transmission (e.g., HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS) and become familiar with their security implications.

• Understand what happens when someone types www.google.com into a web browser.

• Relate network layers (OSI/TCP/IP models) to vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques.

\--

* Explain the function of network devices, the OSI model layers, and how protocols enable host-to-host communication.
* Trace the entire path of a web request, such as typing a URL into a browser, to illustrate applied networking concepts.
* Configure and verify fundamental router operations, including device security, static routes, and standard ACLs.
* Implement and integrate essential network services including DNS, DHCP, and Static NAT.

\--

* **Configure** and verify fundamental router operations using the Cisco IOS CLI, including device security, connected routes, and static routes.
* **Compare and contrast** key transport layer protocols, specifically TCP and UDP, and their use cases.
* **Control** network traffic through the configuration and application of standard Access Control Lists (ACLs).
* **Implement** critical network services by configuring and verifying DHCP client/relay and Static NAT.
