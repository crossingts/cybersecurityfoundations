# Introduction - Networking fundamentals

## Chapter 4: Networking fundamentals

This chapter covers networking fundamentals by way of tracing the movement of a data packet from one host to another across the Internet - highlighting key network devices and network protocols involved, data encapsulation/de-encapsulation against the OSI model layers, and how switches and routers facilitate communication on the network.

**This chapter will help students:**

• Map networking protocols and devices to their functions and OSI model layers.

• Describe data encapsulation/de-encapsulation across OSI model layers.

• Compare switches (intra-network) and routers (inter-network) in facilitating communication.

• Identify common networking protocols involved in data transmission (e.g., HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS) and become familiar with their security implications.

• Understand what happens when someone types www.google.com into a web browser.

• Relate network layers (OSI/TCP/IP models) to vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques.
