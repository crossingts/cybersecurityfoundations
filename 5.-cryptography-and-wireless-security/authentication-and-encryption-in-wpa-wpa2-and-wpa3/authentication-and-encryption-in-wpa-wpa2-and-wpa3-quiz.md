# Authentication and encryption in WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 â€” Quiz

### Authentication and encryption in WPA, WPA2, and WPA3

**1. Which WPA3-Personal feature directly addresses the vulnerability of dictionary attacks that exists in WPA2-Personal? (Choose one answer)**\
a) The use of AES-256-GCMP for encryption \
b) The implementation of Protected Management Frames (PMF) \
**c) The replacement of PSK with Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)**\
d) The optional 192-bit cryptographic suite

**2. What is the primary encryption and integrity algorithm mandated by the WPA2 standard? (Choose one answer)**\
a) Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)\
b) AES-Galois/Counter Mode Protocol (AES-GCMP)\
**c) AES-Counter Mode with CBC-MAC Protocol (AES-CCMP)**\
d) Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)

**3. A network administrator needs to deploy a wireless network that meets modern enterprise security standards like PCI-DSS. Which mode should the administrator use? (Choose one answer)**\
a) WPA2-Personal\
b) WPA3-Personal\
c) WPA-Enterprise\
**d) WPA2-Enterprise or WPA3-Enterprise**

**4. What key security benefit does WPA3-Personal provide by ensuring that a compromised password cannot be used to decrypt previously captured traffic? (Choose one answer)**\
a) Protected Management Frames (PMF)\
**b) Forward Secrecy**\
c) 802.1X Authentication\
d) Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC)

**5. Which of the following accurately describes a key difference in authentication between WPA/WPA2-Personal and Enterprise modes? (Choose one answer)**\
a) Personal mode uses 802.1X/EAP, while Enterprise mode uses a pre-shared key \
**b) Personal mode uses a pre-shared key, while Enterprise mode uses 802.1X/EAP with a RADIUS server** \
c) Enterprise mode uses SAE, while Personal mode uses TKIP \
d) Both modes use PSK, but Enterprise mode adds a second factor
