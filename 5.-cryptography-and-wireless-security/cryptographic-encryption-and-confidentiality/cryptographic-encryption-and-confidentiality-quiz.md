# Cryptographic encryption and confidentiality â€” Quiz

### Cryptographic encryption and confidentiality

**1. What is the primary reason symmetric encryption is preferred for bulk data encryption? (Choose one answer)**\
a) It uses longer keys than asymmetric encryption\
b) It is more secure against brute-force attacks\
**c) Its algorithms are less computationally intensive and faster**\
d) It does not require a key exchange

**2. In an asymmetric encryption scheme, if Bob wants to send a confidential message to Alice, what key does he use to encrypt it? (Choose one answer)**\
a) Bob's own public key\
b) Bob's own private key\
**c) Alice's public key**\
d) Alice's private key

**3. What fundamental problem does hybrid encryption aim to solve? (Choose one answer)**\
a) The slowness of asymmetric encryption for bulk data\
b) The weakness of the DES algorithm\
**c) The key exchange problem inherent in symmetric encryption**\
d) Both a and c

**4. How does a Hash Function (e.g., SHA-256) fundamentally differ from encryption? (Choose one answer)**\
a) It produces a larger output\
b) It is faster to compute\
**c) It is not reversible and does not use a decryption key**\
d) It requires a secret key to generate the digest

**5. Which of the following best describes the purpose of an HMAC compared to a basic hash? (Choose one answer)**\
a) HMAC provides confidentiality, while a hash provides integrity\
**b) HMAC provides integrity and authenticity, while a hash only provides integrity**\
c) HMAC is slower but produces a smaller output\
d) HMAC uses asymmetric keys, while a hash uses symmetric keys
