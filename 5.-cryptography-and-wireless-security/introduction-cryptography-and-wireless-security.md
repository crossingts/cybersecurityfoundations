# Introduction - Cryptography and wireless security

## Chapter 5: Cryptography and wireless security

This chapter covers how SSL/TLS uses cryptographic tools (symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing) to secure data over the Internet, and how the IEEE 802.11 standard provides a basis for a wireless security management framework (client authentication, message privacy, and message integrity).

**This chapter will help students:**

* Develop a foundational understanding of how cryptographic tools (symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing) secure Internet communications via SSL/TLS.
* Understand how symmetric encryption (e.g., AES), asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA), and hashing (e.g., SHA-256) secure data in transit.
* Describe how digital certificates and asymmetric keys enable authentication and message signing.
* Develop a practical understanding of RSAâ€™s key generation, encryption, and signing capabilities.
* Describe the TLS handshake process, from negotiating cryptographic parameters to securely establishing a shared session key.
* Develop a practical understanding of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, its role in providing forward secrecy in TLS, and the underlying mathematics that make it secure.
* Understand how the IEEE 802.11 standard provides a basis for a wireless security management framework (client authentication, message privacy, and message integrity).
* Become familiar with key authentication methods and encryption and message integrity algorithms used in securing wireless networks.
* Compare wireless security protocols (WPA/WPA2/WPA3) and their authentication and encryption methods.
