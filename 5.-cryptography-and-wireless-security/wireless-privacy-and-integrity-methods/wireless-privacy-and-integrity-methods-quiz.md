# Wireless privacy and integrity methods â€” Quiz

### Wireless privacy and integrity methods

**1. What was the primary design constraint that led to the creation of TKIP and the Michael MIC?**  
a) The need for faster data throughput than WEP could provide.  
b) The requirement to replace WEP without requiring new hardware.  
c) A government mandate to use stronger encryption algorithms.  
d) The desire to simplify the user configuration process.  
**Answer: b) The requirement to replace WEP without requiring new hardware.**

**2. How does a Keyed Integrity Check (Message Authentication Code) fundamentally differ from an Unkeyed Integrity Check (Cryptographic Hash) in terms of security?**  
a) A MAC produces a longer output value, making it harder to break.  
b) A MAC uses a secret key, preventing an attacker from forging a valid integrity value.  
c) A cryptographic hash is faster to compute, making it better for real-time communications.  
d) A cryptographic hash provides confidentiality in addition to integrity.  
**Answer: b) A MAC uses a secret key, preventing an attacker from forging a valid integrity value.**

**3. Which WPA3 security component is responsible for providing both encryption and integrity, representing a significant advancement over the separate mechanisms used in WPA?**  
a) TKIP sequence counter  
b) AES-GCMP  
c) The Michael MIC  
d) The Pre-Shared Key (PSK)  
**Answer: b) AES-GCMP**

**4. Why were TKIP and the Michael MIC ultimately deprecated in the 802.11 standard?**  
a) They were too computationally expensive for modern access points.  
b) They were incompatible with the newer 5 GHz frequency band.  
c) They were found to have vulnerabilities and were no longer considered secure.  
d) They required licensing fees that made them prohibitively expensive.  
**Answer: c) They were found to have vulnerabilities and were no longer considered secure.**

**5. What is the primary cryptographic algorithm that provides confidentiality in both the AES-CCMP (WPA2) and AES-GCMP (WPA3) protocols?**  
a) The RC4 stream cipher  
b) The CBC-MAC integrity check  
c) The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in counter mode  
d) The Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC)  
**Answer: c) The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in counter mode**
