# Introduction - Wireless security and cryptography

## Chapter 5: Wireless security and cryptography

This chapter covers how SSL/TLS uses cryptographic tools (symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing) to secure data over the Internet, and how the IEEE 802.11 wireless standard enforces security through authentication, encryption, and integrity mechanisms.

**This chapter will help students:**

• Develop a foundational understanding of how cryptographic tools (symmetric/asymmetric encryption, and hashing) secure Internet communications via SSL/TLS.

• Understand how symmetric encryption (AES), asymmetric encryption (RSA), and hashing (SHA-256) secure data in transit.

• Describe how digital certificates and asymmetric keys enable authentication and message signing.

• Develop a practical understanding of RSA’s key generation, encryption, and signing capabilities.

• Understand how the IEEE 802.11 standard provides a basis for a wireless security management framework (client authentication, message privacy, and message integrity).

• Become familiar with key authentication methods and encryption and message integrity algorithms used in securing wireless networks.
