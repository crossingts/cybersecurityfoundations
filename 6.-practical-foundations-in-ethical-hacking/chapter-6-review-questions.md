# Chapter 6 review questions

### What is professional ethical hacking

**1. What is the single most important characteristic that legally and ethically distinguishes a white hat hacker from a grey hat hacker?**  
**Answer:** The single most important characteristic is that a white hat hacker operates with **explicit, prior authorization** from the system owner, while a grey hat hacker does not.

**2. A professional ethical hacker is bound by a web of professional codes of conduct. Name three broad categories these authoritative codes and standards come from.**  
**Answer:** These codes and standards come from: (1) industry certifications and training authorities (e.g., EC-Council, (ISC)²), (2) professional associations (e.g., ACM, IEEE), and (3) industry standards/guidelines (e.g., OSSTMM, OWASP, NIST).

**3. While both grey hat and black hat hackers operate illegally, what key difference typically exists in their primary motivation?**  
**Answer:** The key difference is that a grey hat hacker's primary motivation is often to force a security fix or gain recognition, sometimes claiming to act in the public interest, whereas a black hat hacker's primary motivation is personal profit, destruction, or espionage.

**4. How do university accreditation bodies, like the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), help instill a professional ethical mindset in future ethical hackers?**  
**Answer:** They require that ethics education be a mandatory part of the degree curriculum, ensuring students learn not only technical skills but also the professional codes of conduct and systematic, ethical decision-making they must follow in their careers.

**5. The lesson states that "trust is the currency of the profession" for an ethical hacker. Why is trust considered so paramount?**  
**Answer:** Trust is paramount because ethical hackers are granted privileged access to an organization's most sensitive systems and data; without absolute trust, clients would not provide the necessary access, and the entire professional relationship would be impossible.

### The perils of unethical hacking

**1. What is the primary legal function of a contract that defines the "Scope of Work" for an ethical hacker?**  
**Answer:** The primary legal function is to provide explicit, prior authorization for the hacker's activities, creating a legal shield that distinguishes their security testing from unauthorized access, which is criminalized under laws like the CFAA.

**2. How can violating a responsible disclosure timeline, as outlined in a contract, negatively impact an ethical hacker?**  
**Answer:** Violating a responsible disclosure timeline is a breach of contract that can lead to the hacker being blacklisted from bug bounty platforms, facing civil liability for damages, and suffering severe reputational damage that ends their professional credibility.

**3. Beyond fines and imprisonment, what is a significant long-term consequence of a felony conviction for unethical hacking?**  
**Answer:** A significant long-term consequence is career destruction, which includes permanent blacklisting from the cybersecurity industry due to failed background checks, leading to long-term unemployment and an inability to rebuild a professional life.

**4. What is the key difference between the motivation of a hacktivist and that of a traditional black hat hacker?**  
**Answer:** The key difference is that a hacktivist is primarily motivated by political or social causes, e.g., promoting their ideology, whereas a black hat hacker is primarily motivated by personal profit, criminal intent, or malicious destruction.

**5. How do professional bodies like (ISC)² enforce accountability for certified ethical hackers?**
**Answer:** They enforce accountability by maintaining and upholding a strict code of ethics, and they possess the authority to revoke certifications (like the CISSP) from members who engage in unethical or illegal behavior, thereby ending their credentialed status.
