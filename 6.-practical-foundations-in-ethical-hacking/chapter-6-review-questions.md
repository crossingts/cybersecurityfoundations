# Chapter 6 review questions

### What is professional ethical hacking

**1. What is the single most important characteristic that legally and ethically distinguishes a white hat hacker from a grey hat hacker?**  
**Answer:** The single most important characteristic is that a white hat hacker operates with **explicit, prior authorization** from the system owner, while a grey hat hacker does not.

**2. A professional ethical hacker is bound by a web of professional codes of conduct. Name three broad categories these authoritative codes and standards come from.**  
**Answer:** These codes and standards come from: (1) industry certifications and training authorities (e.g., EC-Council, (ISC)²), (2) professional associations (e.g., ACM, IEEE), and (3) industry standards/guidelines (e.g., OSSTMM, OWASP, NIST).

**3. While both grey hat and black hat hackers operate illegally, what key difference typically exists in their primary motivation?**  
**Answer:** The key difference is that a grey hat hacker's primary motivation is often to force a security fix or gain recognition, sometimes claiming to act in the public interest, whereas a black hat hacker's primary motivation is personal profit, destruction, or espionage.

**4. How do university accreditation bodies, like the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), help instill a professional ethical mindset in future ethical hackers?**  
**Answer:** They require that ethics education be a mandatory part of the degree curriculum, ensuring students learn not only technical skills but also the professional codes of conduct and systematic, ethical decision-making they must follow in their careers.

**5. The lesson states that "trust is the currency of the profession" for an ethical hacker. Why is trust considered so paramount?**  
**Answer:** Trust is paramount because ethical hackers are granted privileged access to an organization's most sensitive systems and data; without absolute trust, clients would not provide the necessary access, and the entire professional relationship would be impossible.

### The perils of unethical hacking

**1. What is the primary legal function of a contract that defines the "Scope of Work" for an ethical hacker?**  
**Answer:** The primary legal function is to provide explicit, prior authorization for the hacker's activities, creating a legal shield that distinguishes their security testing from unauthorized access, which is criminalized under laws like the CFAA.

**2. How can violating a responsible disclosure timeline, as outlined in a contract, negatively impact an ethical hacker?**  
**Answer:** Violating a responsible disclosure timeline is a breach of contract that can lead to the hacker being blacklisted from bug bounty platforms, facing civil liability for damages, and suffering severe reputational damage that ends their professional credibility.

**3. Beyond fines and imprisonment, what is a significant long-term consequence of a felony conviction for unethical hacking?**  
**Answer:** A significant long-term consequence is career destruction, which includes permanent blacklisting from the cybersecurity industry due to failed background checks, leading to long-term unemployment and an inability to rebuild a professional life.

**4. What is the key difference between the motivation of a hacktivist and that of a traditional black hat hacker?**  
**Answer:** The key difference is that a hacktivist is primarily motivated by political or social causes, e.g., promoting their ideology, whereas a black hat hacker is primarily motivated by personal profit, criminal intent, or malicious destruction.

**5. How do professional bodies like (ISC)² enforce accountability for certified ethical hackers?**
**Answer:** They enforce accountability by maintaining and upholding a strict code of ethics, and they possess the authority to revoke certifications (like the CISSP) from members who engage in unethical or illegal behavior, thereby ending their credentialed status.

### What do ethical hackers do?

**1. Describe the purpose of a vulnerability assessment and list two key activities involved in the process.**  
Answer: The purpose of a vulnerability assessment is to systematically identify, quantify, and prioritize vulnerabilities in a system. Two key activities involved are asset discovery (using tools like Nmap to catalog hosts and services) and active or passive scanning (using tools like Nessus or Zeek to detect known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations).

**2. According to the NIST definition provided in the lesson, what are the three key elements a risk assessment process aims to identify regarding risks to system security?**  
Answer: A risk assessment aims to identify: (1) the risks to system security, (2) the probability of their occurrence, and (3) the resulting impact of those risks.

**3. A client needs to conduct a security evaluation. What are the three practical questions they must ponder, as defined by Palmer (2001), before beginning?**  
Answer: The client must determine: (1) What they are trying to protect (critical assets), (2) What they are trying to protect against (threats and loss events), and (3) How much time, effort, and money they are willing to expend to obtain adequate protection.

 **4. Explain the key difference in purpose between a vulnerability scan and a penetration test.**
Answer: A vulnerability scan serves as a detective control, aiming to identify and list known software vulnerabilities that may be exploited. A penetration test acts as a preventative control, aiming to actually exploit vulnerabilities to demonstrate what data can be compromised and discover unknown exposures.

**5. What is the role of penetration testing in relation to the findings of a vulnerability assessment, and what does this process provide for an organization?**  
Answer: The role of penetration testing is to act as a proof of concept by actively and safely exploiting vulnerabilities discovered during the vulnerability assessment. This process validates the vulnerability assessment results and provides tangible proof of the actual risk and business impact posed by the vulnerabilities.
