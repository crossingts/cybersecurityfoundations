# Attack types (CEH/EC-Council)

Attack Types (Walker, 2012, p. 12)

EC Council broadly defines four categories of security attacks:

• Operating system attacks — Generally speaking, these attacks target the common mistake many people make when installing operating systems—accepting and leaving all the defaults. Things like administrator accounts with no passwords, all ports left open, and guest accounts (the list could go on forever) are examples of settings the installer may forget about. Additionally, operating systems are never released fully secure—they can’t be, if you ever plan on releasing them within a timeframe of actual use—so the potential for an old vulnerability in newly installed operating systems is always a plus for the ethical hacker.

• Application-level attacks — These are attacks on the actual programming codes of an application. Although most people are very cognizant of securing their OS and network, it’s amazing how often they discount the applications running on their OS and network. Many applications on a network aren’t tested for vulnerabilities as part of their creation and, as such, have many vulnerabilities built into them. Applications on a network are a goldmine for most hackers.

• Shrink-wrap code attacks — These attacks take advantage of the built-in code and scripts most off-the-shelf applications come with. The old refrain “Why reinvent the wheel?” is very often used to describe this attack type. Why spend time writing code to attack something when you can buy it already “shrink wrapped”? These scripts and code pieces are designed to make installation and administration easier, but can lead to vulnerabilities if not managed appropriately.

• Misconfiguration attacks — These attacks take advantage of systems that are, on purpose or by accident, not configured appropriately for security. Misconfigurations include insecure default settings, insecure default credentials, and improperly configured services.
