### Misconfigured security settings

Misconfigured security settings occur when systems, applications, or networks are set up insecurely, leaving them vulnerable to attacks. Unlike simple **default settings issues**, misconfigurations can arise from **human error, lack of security awareness, or poor maintenance**.

**Common Examples of Security Misconfigurations**

**1. Exposed Admin Interfaces**

* Web-based admin dashboards (e.g., `/admin`, `/wp-admin`, `/manager`) left publicly accessible.
* **Real-world example:**
  * **Jenkins servers** exposed online without authentication, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
  * **Router admin panels** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) exposed to the internet, leading to credential brute-forcing.

**2. Unprotected Cloud Storage (S3 Buckets, Blob Storage)**

* AWS S3 buckets or Azure Blob Storage set to **public** instead of private.
* **Example:**
  * **Verizon (2017)** – Misconfigured S3 bucket exposed **6 million customer records**.
  * **Facebook (2019)** – Publicly accessible databases leaked **540 million user records**.

**3. Verbose Error Messages**

* Applications revealing **stack traces, database errors, or server details** in production.
* **Example:**
  * SQL errors exposing table names, helping attackers refine SQL injection attacks.

**4. Unsecured APIs**

* APIs with **no authentication**, **excessive data exposure**, or **deprecated versions** left running.
* **Example:**
  * **Peloton (2021)** – API leaked user data due to lack of authentication checks.

**5. Directory Listing Enabled**

* Web servers (Apache, Nginx) allow **browsing of directories**, exposing sensitive files.
* **Example:**
  * A misconfigured backup directory might expose `.bak` or `.sql` files containing credentials.

**6. Unnecessary HTTP Methods (PUT, DELETE, TRACE)**

* Web servers allowing dangerous methods (e.g., **PUT** for file uploads, **DELETE** for wiping data).
* **Example:**
  * Attackers exploit **HTTP PUT** to upload malicious scripts (e.g., web shells).

**7. Default or Sample Files Left Installed**

* Web servers with **default pages** (e.g., `phpinfo.php`, `test.cgi`) that leak system info.
* **Example:**
  * **Oracle WebLogic** had default samples vulnerable to remote code execution (CVE-2020-14882).

**8. Improper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Policies**

* Misconfigured CORS allows **any domain** to access APIs, leading to data theft.
* **Example:**
  * A banking site allowing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` could leak sensitive data via malicious scripts.

**9. Missing Security Headers**

* Lack of **HTTP Security Headers** (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`).
* **Example:**
  * Clickjacking attacks succeed when `X-Frame-Options` is missing.

**10. Unrestricted File Uploads**

* Web apps allowing **executable files** (`.php`, `.jsp`) to be uploaded without validation.
* **Example:**
  * Attackers upload a `.php` shell to gain remote control (e.g., **Alibaba Cloud (2020)**).

**How to Prevent Security Misconfigurations?**

✅ **Disable admin interfaces from public access** (use VPNs or IP whitelisting).\
✅ **Follow the principle of least privilege** (restrict permissions).\
✅ **Automate security checks** (use tools like **AWS Config, Nessus, OpenVAS**).\
✅ **Disable directory listing & unnecessary HTTP methods**.\
✅ **Remove default/sample files** and disable debug modes in production.\
✅ **Implement proper CORS & security headers**.\
✅ **Regularly audit configurations** (using **OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite**).

### Insecure default settings

Misconfigurations occur when systems, applications, or networks are improperly set up, often due to reliance on **default settings** that prioritize ease of deployment over security. Here are common examples:

**1. Default Credentials**

* Many devices (routers, IoT devices, servers) ship with **default usernames and passwords** (e.g., `admin:admin`).
* **Example:** Attackers scan for devices with unchanged default logins (e.g., Mirai botnet exploited default IoT credentials).

**2. Open or Unrestricted Ports & Services**

* Unnecessary services (e.g., Telnet, FTP, SMB) left enabled by default.
* **Example:** EternalBlue exploited open SMB ports in Windows systems.

**3. Excessive Permissions**

* Default configurations granting **unnecessary privileges** (e.g., "Everyone: Full Control" in file shares).
* **Example:** AWS S3 buckets set to **public by default**, leading to data leaks.

**4. Debug Mode Enabled in Production**

* Web applications/frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask) sometimes run in **debug mode by default**, exposing sensitive data.

**5. Directory Listing Enabled**

* Web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx) may allow **directory traversal**, exposing files unintentionally.

**6. Unpatched or Outdated Default Software**

* Some systems ship with **old, vulnerable software versions** (e.g., outdated PHP, WordPress plugins).

**7. Default Cryptographic Keys/Certificates**

* Devices (e.g., routers, IoT) sometimes use **hardcoded encryption keys**, making decryption easy for attackers.

**8. Cloud Misconfigurations**

* **Example:**
  * Publicly accessible **Kubernetes dashboards**.
  * **Overprivileged IAM roles** in AWS/Azure.
  * **Unencrypted storage** (e.g., databases/blobs set to public).

**9. Unsecured APIs**

* APIs with **no authentication**, **exposed admin endpoints**, or **excessive data exposure** by default.

**10. Lack of Logging/Monitoring**

* Many systems **do not log security events by default**, allowing attackers to operate undetected.

#### **Real-World Exploits Due to Misconfigurations**

* **MongoDB ransomware attacks** (databases left exposed without authentication).
* **Citrix ADC (CVE-2019-19781)** – Default settings allowed remote code execution.
* **Elasticsearch data leaks** – No authentication enabled by default.

#### **How to Prevent Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities?**

✔ **Change default credentials** immediately.\
✔ **Disable unnecessary services/ports**.\
✔ **Follow least-privilege principles** (restrict permissions).\
✔ **Enable security features** (encryption, logging, WAFs).\
✔ **Regularly audit configurations** (using tools like **Nessus, OpenVAS, AWS Config**).
