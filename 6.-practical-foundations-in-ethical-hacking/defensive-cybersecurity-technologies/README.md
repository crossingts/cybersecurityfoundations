# Defensive cybersecurity technologies

## Learning objectives

* Become familiar with popular open source host and network firewalls, their key features, and their common use cases
* Become familiar with popular open source host- and network-based IDS, their key features, and their common use cases
* Become familiar with popular open source security event management technologies, their key features, and their common use cases
* Become familiar with popular open source packet analyzers, their key features, and their common use cases
* Understand the difference between Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and packet-filtering firewalls

This section explores major defensive cybersecurity technologies, including firewalls, IDS/IPS, SIEM/EDR, and packet analyzers. The discussion focuses on popular open-source tools used to implement these technologies, exploring their key characteristics and deployment (use cases). Key categories of defensive cybersecurity technologies discussed include host/network firewalls (e.g., UFW, iptables, nftables, PF, OPNsense, and pfSense), IDS/IPS (e.g., Suricata and Snort), network security monitoring/SIEM (e.g., Wazuh and OSSEC), and packet analyzers (e.g., Wireshark and tcpdump).

Note that many powerful open-source security tools have overlapping capabilities and can span multiple functional categories. A tool primarily classified as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), like Suricata, might also provide critical log data for a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. This discussion categorizes tools by their primary function, but their real-world value often lies in how they are integrated into a broader security architecture.

**Packet Filtering Firewalls**

Packet-filtering firewall technologies such as iptables and pfilter (PF) operate at the network level (Layer 3/4). Packet-filtering firewalls allow network administrators to define rules for allowing, blocking, or modifying traffic based on IPs, ports, protocols, and connection states.

UFW, iptables, nftables, PF, ipfw, OPNsense, and pfSense (CE) are all considered packet filtering firewalls, but some have evolved into more sophisticated frameworks.

**Primarily packet filtering firewalls:**

**iptables:** This is the classic Linux packet filter. It operates at layers 3 and 4, making decisions based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, and connection state (stateful packet filtering).

**PF (Packet Filter):** Originally from OpenBSD, it is a core stateful packet filter. Like iptables, it forms the foundation for firewalling on systems that use it (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, etc.).

**UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):** This is not a new firewall itself, but a user-friendly front-end (a wrapper) for `iptables` (and on newer systems, `nftables`). It simplifies the process of creating packet filtering rules.

**Evolved successors/systems with broader capabilities:**

**nftables:** This is the modern successor to iptables in the Linux kernel. While it is fundamentally a packet filtering engine, it is more than _just_ a packet filter. It unifies various network filtering frameworks into a single, more efficient tool and has a more flexible syntax. For all intents and purposes, it performs the same core function as a stateful packet filter but is considered its evolution.

**pfSense and OPNsense:** These are complete, GUI-based firewall _distributions_ (operating systems). They use **PF (Packet Filter)** as their core _packet filtering engine_. However, the systems themselves are full-featured **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)** because they include many features beyond simple packet filtering.

**Stateful Inspection Firewalls**  

While basic packet filters look at each packet in isolation, stateful firewalls track the state of active connections.

A packet filter might have a rule "Allow incoming traffic to port 80." A stateful firewall understands if the traffic on port 80 is a response to an internal request (part of an established connection) or an unsolicited new connection, providing much stronger security.

We've established that UFW, iptables, nftables, PF, ipfw, OPNsense, and pfSense (CE) are all considered packet filtering firewalls. Are they all also considered stateful ?

Statefulness is not an inherent property of the basic technology in all cases. Statefulness is a key feature that these systems implement.

Let's break it down:
#### The Stateful vs. Stateless Distinction

- **Stateless Firewall:** Looks at each network packet in isolation. It doesn't remember previous packets. A rule like "allow TCP port 80" means _all_ packets to port 80 are allowed, regardless of whether they are part of a new connection or a random malicious packet.
    
- **Stateful Firewall:** Tracks the state of active connections (e.g., SYN, SYN-ACK, ESTABLISHED, RELATED, FIN) to make dynamic decisions. A stateful firewall understands sessions. It can tell the difference between an outgoing request to a web server and the returning traffic, and it can automatically allow the return traffic for an established session. This is a fundamental security improvement.

**Yes, These are Inherently Stateful:**

- **nftables:** Has a built-in state machine (`ct state`) and connection tracking is a core part of its design.
    
- **PF (Packet Filter):** Stateful filtering is a fundamental and default feature. The `keep state` and `modulate state` options are central to its rule syntax.
    
- **ipfw:** Has a built-in stateful mechanism using the `check-state`, `keep-state`, and `limit` keywords in its rules.
    
- **OPNsense & pfSense (CE):** As firewall distributions built on top of **PF**, they inherit and fully utilize its stateful capabilities. Stateful inspection is a core, non-negotiable part of their operation.

**keep state in PF (OpenBSD Packet Filter)**

**`keep state` (PF) or `--ctstate` (iptables)** = Enables stateful filtering.

*   When PF sees a rule like:

    sh

    ```
    pass in proto tcp from any to 192.168.1.1 port 22 keep state
    ```

    * It **allows** the initial packet (e.g., TCP SYN).
    * Then, it **automatically permits** subsequent packets in the same flow (ACKs, data, etc.) without requiring additional rules.
    * It also **blocks** packets that donâ€™t match a known state (e.g., unsolicited responses).


**Stateful by Use (Requires Explicit Configuration):**

- **iptables:** This is the most important case. iptables itself is a framework that _can_ be stateful, but it requires the connection tracking module (`conntrack`) and rules that use the `--state` or `--ctstate` match.
    
    - A rule like `-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT` is **stateless**.
        
    - A rule like `-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT` is what makes the firewall **stateful**. This is considered a best practice and is how iptables is almost always used in modern configurations.
        
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):** As a front-end for iptables/nftables, UFW simplifies this. **By default, UFW is configured to be stateful.** Its default rules and profile setup heavily rely on tracking connection states for ease of use and security.

**Connection Tracking (`conntrack`)**

* **Definition:** `conntrack` (connection tracking) is a subsystem in the Linux kernel (part of Netfilter) that monitors and records the state of network connections (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
* **Purpose:** It allows iptables/nftables to make decisions based on the **state** of a connection rather than just individual packets.

**How It Works**

* When a packet arrives, `conntrack` checks if it belongs to an **existing connection** (e.g., an ongoing TCP session).
* If it's a **new connection**, it gets logged in a connection tracking table (`/proc/net/nf_conntrack`).
* Subsequent packets are matched against this table to determine if they are part of an established, related, or invalid connection.

**Common States in `conntrack`**

| State           | Meaning                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NEW**         | First packet of a new connection (e.g., TCP SYN).                                |
| **ESTABLISHED** | Packets belonging to an already-seen connection (e.g., TCP handshake completed). |
| **RELATED**     | Packets related to an existing connection (e.g., FTP data connection).           |
| **INVALID**     | Malformed or suspicious packets (e.g., TCP RST without prior connection).        |

**Example Rule (iptables)**

sh

```
iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```

This rule **allows** packets that are part of an existing or related connection.



### Summary Table

|Firewall|Stateful?|Key Detail|
|---|---|---|
|**iptables**|**Yes (by configuration)**|Requires `conntrack` module and rules using `--state`/`--ctstate`. This is the standard way it's used.|
|**nftables**|**Yes (inherently)**|Connection tracking (`ct`) is a core component of the modern nftables framework.|
|**PF**|**Yes (inherently)**|Stateful filtering (`keep state`) is a default and fundamental feature.|
|**ipfw**|**Yes (inherently)**|Uses `keep-state` and `check-state` commands for stateful inspection.|
|**UFW**|**Yes (by default)**|As a wrapper, it configures the underlying iptables/nftables to be stateful by default.|
|**OPNsense**|**Yes (inherently)**|Built on PF, so stateful inspection is a core, non-optional feature.|
|**pfSense**|**Yes (inherently)**|Built on PF, so stateful inspection is a core, non-optional feature.|

**Conclusion**

To be precise:

- **nftables, PF, ipfw, OPNsense, and pfSense** are architected as **stateful packet filters**.
    
- **iptables** is a framework that is almost universally **used as a stateful firewall**, but the statefulness comes from its connection tracking module, not the `iptables` command itself.
    
- **UFW** is a tool that **configures a stateful firewall** by default.
    

Therefore, in modern practical terms, **yes, they are all considered stateful packet filtering firewalls.** You would have to go out of your way to configure iptables in a purely stateless manner, and it's not recommended.

**Application-Level Gateways (Proxy Firewalls)**  

These operate at Layer 7 (the Application layer). Instead of just forwarding packets, they act as an intermediary.

A proxy firewall terminates the client connection and initiates a new one to the server on its behalf. It can inspect the actual content of the traffic (e.g., specific HTTP commands, SQL queries, etc.), which a Layer 3/4 packet filter is completely blind to.

Most firewalls now have some form of proxy server architecture. 

**Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)**

Packet filtering firewalls are the oldest and most basic type. 
Packet filtering firewalls can be contrasted with firewalls that operate at higher layers of the OSI model and make more intelligent packet filtering decisions.


NGFWs can perform stateful and Application layer packet filtering, in addition to:

- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** Looking _inside_ the packet payload (like a proxy) to identify applications (e.g., "This is Facebook traffic," not just "HTTP traffic on port 80").
- **Integrated Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** Actively blocking known threats and attack patterns within the traffic flow.
- **User & Group Identity Integration:** Blocking or allowing traffic based on user identity (e.g., from Active Directory), not just IP address.
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds:** Leveraging cloud-based data to block traffic from known malicious sources.

**Summary Table**

|Feature|Packet Filtering Firewall|Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)|
|---|---|---|
|**Primary OSI Layer**|**Layers 3 & 4** (Network & Transport)|**Layers 3-7** (Network to Application)|
|**Decision Basis**|IP Address, Port, Protocol|IP, Port, Protocol, **Application, User, Content**|
|**Connection Awareness**|Stateless or Stateful|**Stateful** by default|
|**Traffic Inspection**|Header-only|**Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** of payload|
|**Additional Features**|Basic NAT, basic logging|**IPS, Anti-Virus, Threat Intelligence, Identity Awareness**|

In conclusion, while tools like `iptables` and `PF` are powerful and effective stateful packet filters, they are contrasted with more advanced firewalls that can see and control _what_ is inside the traffic, not just _where_ it's coming from and going to.

**BSD-Based Firewalls**

BSD-based firewalls use networking and security tools native to BSD systems. BSD stands for Berkeley Software Distribution, a family of **Unix-like operating systems** derived from the original Berkeley Unix (developed at UC Berkeley).

**Key BSD Variants in Firewalling**

| BSD OS             | Firewall Used                          | Notes                                                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenBSD**        | **PF (Packet Filter)**                 | Famously secure/the gold standard for BSD firewalls (used in OPNsense/pfSense). |
| **FreeBSD**        | **PF** or **ipfw**                     | Supports both, but PF is more modern.                                           |
| **NetBSD**         | **NPF** or **IPFilter**                | Less common in firewalls.                                                       |
| **macOS (Darwin)** | **ipfw (legacy)** / **PF (partially)** | macOS inherited some BSD firewall tools.                                        |

### Stateless vs stateful firewalls

          â†³ (e.g., "Is this a reply to an existing SSH session?")
```

Stateful and stateless firewalls serve different purposes in network security, each with its own advantages. Hereâ€™s a comparison highlighting the **advantages of stateful firewalls over stateless firewalls**:

**Advantages of Stateful Firewalls:**

Most modern firewalls (e.g., NGFW) are stateful by default due to their security advantages.

1. **Context-Aware Traffic Filtering**
   * Stateful firewalls track the **state** of active connections (e.g., TCP handshakes, UDP sessions), allowing them to make smarter decisions.
   * Example: Only allows inbound traffic if itâ€™s part of an established outbound connection.
2. **Better Security Against Attacks**
   * Can detect and block malicious traffic that abuses protocol states (e.g., TCP SYN floods, session hijacking).
   * Prevents unauthorized traffic that doesnâ€™t match an existing connection.
3. **Granular Control Over Sessions**
   * Can enforce policies based on connection state (e.g., allow only "established" or "related" traffic).
   * Supports dynamic rule adjustments (e.g., temporarily opening ports for FTP data connections).
4. **Protection Against Spoofing & DoS**
   * Recognizes abnormal traffic patterns (e.g., unexpected RST or FIN packets).
   * Can enforce rate limiting per connection.
5. **Supports Complex Protocols**
   * Handles protocols like FTP, SIP, and VoIP that use dynamic ports by tracking their control sessions.
6. **Logging & Monitoring**
   * Provides detailed logs of connection states, aiding in forensic analysis and troubleshooting.

**Why Stateful Filtering is Useful**

âœ… **Simpler Rules**: No need to manually allow reply traffic.\
âœ… **Security**: Blocks unsolicited/invalid packets (e.g., spoofed ACKs).\
âœ… **Performance**: Faster than checking every packet against all rules.

**When Stateless Firewalls Are Better:**

Stateless firewalls (ACLs) are simpler and faster but lack intelligence. They are useful for:

* High-speed networks where performance is critical (e.g., backbone routers).
* Simple packet filtering based on static rules (e.g., IP/port blocking).
* Environments where connection tracking isnâ€™t needed.

### Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

**WAF key characteristics:**

* Scope: Inspects payloads (e.g., "Block HTTP requests with SQLi").
* L7 Awareness: Understands HTTP, DNS, etc. (deep packet inspection)
* Performance Impact: High (parses full packets).

WAFs can be **host-based and network-based**, depending on deployment:

| Type                  | Example Tools                         | Deployment                                                      |

#### Stateless vs Stateful Firewalls

A stateless firewall performs packet filtering based solely on the static rule set and the headers of the individual packet in question, with no memory of prior packets. This necessitates explicit, bidirectional rules for any permitted communication. For example, to allow outbound HTTP, you would need one rule permitting TCP from an internal network to port 80 on any host, and a corresponding rule permitting TCP from any host on port 80 back to the internal network. This model cannot distinguish a legitimate HTTP response from an unsolicited incoming connection attempt, creating a larger attack surface. While stateless filtering is computationally cheaper and thus persists in high-throughput core routing (e.g., basic ACLs on Cisco IOS) or specific DDoS mitigation layers, its inherent limitations in security and administrative overhead have relegated it to niche roles.

In comparison, a stateful firewall operates at the network and transport layers but maintains a dynamic state table, often implemented within the kernel's connection tracking subsystem (`conntrack` in Linux, `pfstate` in OpenBSD). This table holds entries for each active session (e.g., source/destination IP, source/destination port, and protocol) and the TCP state (e.g., SYN_SENT, ESTABLISHED, and FIN_WAIT). For a TCP handshake, the firewall inspects the initial SYN packet, creates a state, and then validates the returning SYN-ACK against that state before permitting it. This allows for a fundamental rule simplification: a single `pass out` rule for an outgoing connection implicitly creates a temporary, dynamic `pass in` rule for the return traffic. Stateful inspection is the de facto standard in modern firewalls like PF (where `keep state` is the default on `pass` rules) and nftables (which leverages the `ct` expression for state matching).

#### Traffic Shaping

Traffic shaping is the active control of network traffic characteristics to enforce QoS policies, primarily implemented through queuing disciplines (qdiscs) and schedulers that manage packet buffers on egress interfaces. The core algorithmic model is the token bucket filter, which defines a bucket that fills with tokens at a specified rate (the committed information rate, or CIR) up to a defined burst capacity. Each packet requires a token of size proportional to its length to be transmitted; if the bucket is empty, the packet is delayed in a queue rather than immediately dropped (which would be policing). This mechanism smooths traffic bursts and enforces bandwidth ceilings.

* Popular open source host-based firewalls include nftables and pf.
* Popular open source network-based firewalls include OPNsense and pfSense (CE).
* Packet-filtering firewall technologies such as iptables and pfilter (PF) operate at the network level (Layer 3/4).
* WAFs operate at the Application level (L7) and can be host- and network-based.
* Popular open source HIDS include Wazuh and OSSEC.
* Popular open source NIDS include Suricata and Snort.
* Popular open source SIEM include Wazuh and TheHive.
* Popular open source packet analyzers include Wireshark and tcpdump.

**Stateful Firewalls:** Open-source examples include iptables/nftables (Linux), PF (BSD), and OPNsense.
* **Use stateful firewalls** when you need **stronger security**, session awareness, and protection against modern threats.
* **Use stateless firewalls** for **raw speed** or when dealing with simple, static filtering.

**Firewall Roots:** Linux uses Netfilter (iptables/nftables), BSD uses PF/ipfw, Windows uses WFP.

**WAFs:** Can be host-based (ModSecurity) or network-based (Cloudflare WAF). Host WAF: Protects a single service (e.g., one NGINX instance). Network WAF: Protects all traffic before it reaches servers (e.g., a reverse proxy).
