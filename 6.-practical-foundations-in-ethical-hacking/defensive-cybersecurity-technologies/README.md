* **Platform**: Linux (Ubuntu default).
* **Key Features**:
  * Simplified CLI for managing firewall rules (easier than raw `iptables`).
  * Supports IPv4 and IPv6.
  * Predefined application profiles (e.g., allow SSH, HTTP).
  * Integrates with `iptables` or `nftables` as the backend.
  * Designed for simplicity, ideal for desktop users and beginners.

#### **2. iptables**

* **Type**: Host/network firewall (kernel-level).
* **Platform**: Linux.
* **Key Features**:
  * Traditional Linux firewall using Netfilter framework.
  * Rule-based system (chains: INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD).
  * Supports NAT, packet filtering, and stateful inspection.
  * Complex syntax (requires expertise).
  * Being replaced by `nftables` but still widely used.

#### **3. nftables**

* **Type**: Host/network firewall (successor to `iptables`).
* **Platform**: Linux (kernel ≥ 3.13).
* **Key Features**:
  * Unified framework replacing `iptables`, `ip6tables`, `arptables`, etc.
  * Simpler syntax with JSON support.
  * Faster rule processing and better scalability.
  * Supports sets and maps for dynamic rules.
  * Backward-compatible with `iptables` via translation tools.

#### **4. PF (Packet Filter) / pfilter**

* **Type**: Host/network firewall.
* **Platform**: BSD (OpenBSD default, also FreeBSD, macOS).
* **Key Features**:
  * Stateful firewall with advanced features (NAT, QoS, traffic shaping).
  * Clean, readable rule syntax (e.g., `pass in on eth0 proto tcp to port 22`).
  * Supports logging, SYN proxy, and scrubbing.
  * Integrated in OpenBSD (security-focused).

#### **5. OPNsense**

* **Type**: Network firewall/router (open-source fork of pfSense).
* **Platform**: FreeBSD-based (dedicated appliance/VM).
* **Key Features**:
  * Web GUI for easy management.
  * Supports VPN (OpenVPN, WireGuard), IDS/IPS (Suricata), and traffic shaping.
  * Regular updates with a focus on security and usability.
  * Plugins for extended functionality (e.g., Nginx, CrowdSec).
  * Community and commercial support options.

#### **6. pfSense (Community Edition)**

* **Type**: Network firewall/router.
* **Platform**: FreeBSD-based (dedicated appliance/VM).
* **Key Features**:
  * Fork of m0n0wall, widely used in enterprises.
  * Web GUI with advanced features (VPN, captive portal, CARP for HA).
  * Supports packages (Snort, Squid, HAProxy).
  * Stateful firewall, NAT, and traffic shaping.
  * Large community but slower updates than OPNsense.
