* **For deep analysis**: **Wireshark** (GUI) or **tcpdump** (CLI).
* **For traffic logging**: **Zeek** (creates structured logs).
* **For security monitoring**: **Snort** (NIDS mode).
* **For large-scale PCAP storage**: **Arkime** (web-based).

**Workflow Examples**:

1. **Capture with tcpdump** â†’ Analyze in Wireshark.
2. **Zeek for traffic logs** + Arkime for PCAP retention.
3. **Snort for alerts** â†’ Inspect PCAPs in Wireshark.
