# IDS/IPS—Suricata

Introduction to Suricata: What is Suricata, a short historical background, common use cases, and popular integrations in system security design.

#### **Suricata: The High-Performance Open-Source IDS/IPS**

**Overview and History**

Suricata is a robust, open-source (GPLv2) Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) developed by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF) in 2010. Designed to address the limitations of older tools like Snort, Suricata was built for modern high-speed networks, offering multi-threading, hardware acceleration support, and native JSON output for easier integration with SIEMs and analytics platforms. Unlike Snort’s single-threaded architecture, Suricata leverages parallel processing to handle gigabit+ traffic without dropping packets, making it a favorite for enterprises and service providers. The project is community-driven, with contributions from major vendors like Stamus Networks and NVIDIA (for GPU-accelerated pattern matching).

**Technical Capabilities and Use Cases**

Suricata operates as both a network-based IDS (NIDS) and IPS, with deep packet inspection (DPI) and protocol analysis. Key features include:

* **Signature-based detection** (using rulesets like Emerging Threats or ET Open).
* **Anomaly-based detection** (via protocol analysis and heuristic rules).
* **TLS/SSL decryption** (for inspecting encrypted threats).
* **File extraction and malware detection** (e.g., HTTP, SMTP, SMB files).
* **EVE JSON logging** for structured output to tools like Elasticsearch.

Common deployments include:

* **Enterprise network monitoring** (inline or tap-based).
* **Cloud and hybrid environments** (e.g., AWS VPC traffic mirroring).
* **Threat hunting** (via PCAP analysis and retrospection).

**Defense Pipeline Integrations**

In a layered security model, Suricata enhances visibility and threat blocking:

1. **Perimeter Defense**: Deployed at network edges to detect and block exploits (e.g., CVE scans, ransomware C2 traffic).
2. **Internal Traffic Analysis**: Monitoring east-west traffic for lateral movement (integrated with Zeek/Bro for full metadata capture).
3. **Automated Response**: Triggering block rules in firewalls (e.g., OPNsense, pfSense) via APIs or tools like Fail2Ban.
4. **SIEM Enrichment**: Sending normalized logs to Splunk, Elastic Security, or Sigma for correlation.

Suricata’s flexibility—running on bare metal, virtual appliances, or embedded hardware—makes it a cornerstone of modern security operations centers (SOCs).

### Snort vs. Suricata

| **Feature**          | **Snort**                            | **Suricata**                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Detection Type**   | Signature-based NIDS/NIPS            | Signature + anomaly-based NIDS/NIPS |
| **Performance**      | Single-threaded                      | Multi-threaded (scales better)      |
| **Rule Sources**     | Talos, Emerging Threats (ET)         | ET Open, ET Pro, custom Lua rules   |
| **IPS Mode**         | Yes (inline via `afpacket`/`nfq`)    | Yes (inline via `nfqueue`)          |
| **Protocol Support** | Basic (HTTP, DNS, etc.)              | Advanced (HTTP/2, TLS, QUIC)        |
| **File Extraction**  | Limited (via preprocessors)          | Built-in (PCAP, files, TLS logs)    |
| **Logging Format**   | Plaintext, unified2 binary           | EVE JSON (SIEM-friendly)            |
| **Scripting**        | Limited (preprocessors in C)         | Lua scripting for advanced rules    |
| **Hardware Usage**   | Lower RAM/CPU                        | Higher RAM (due to multithreading)  |
| **Best For**         | Small/medium networks, legacy setups | High-speed networks, modern threats |

#### **Key Takeaways**

* **Snort** is simpler, lightweight, and ideal for smaller deployments.
* **Suricata** is more scalable, with modern protocol support and better SIEM integration.
* Both support **inline IPS mode**, but Suricata handles encrypted traffic (TLS) better.
