# Zeek (NIDS)

### Zeek's key capabilities: IDS, SIEM, or packet analyzer?

Zeek (formerly Bro) is a powerful network analysis framework, widely used in research and enterprises. Zeek can be categorized as a **Network Security Monitoring (NSM) tool** that functions primarily as a **packet analyzer** and **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** in its most common applications. Here’s a breakdown of how it fits into these categories:

#### **1. Packet Analyzer (Primary Role)**

* Zeek operates by deeply inspecting network traffic (like Wireshark/Tcpdump but at scale).
* It reconstructs sessions, extracts files, and logs high-level protocol transactions (HTTP, DNS, SSL, etc.) rather than just raw packets.
* Unlike simple packet captures, Zeek generates structured logs (`.log` files) that are easier to analyze.

#### **2. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**

* Zeek is often used as a **passive, signature-less IDS** (though it can integrate signatures via frameworks like Suricata).
* It detects anomalies by analyzing protocol behavior, not just pattern matching (unlike traditional IDS/IPS).
* It doesn’t actively block traffic (not an IPS by default), but it can trigger alerts or external actions.

#### **3. Network Security Monitoring (NSM)**

* Zeek excels in **NSM** by providing visibility into network activity for threat hunting, forensics, and anomaly detection.
* It’s a core tool in NSM alongside tools like Suricata, Elasticsearch, and Splunk.

#### **What Zeek is NOT:**

* **Not a SIEM**: While Zeek generates logs that can feed into a SIEM (like Splunk, ELK), it lacks SIEM features like centralized correlation, dashboards, or long-term storage.
* **Not an EDR**: Zeek monitors network traffic, not endpoint processes/memory (unlike CrowdStrike, Carbon Black).
* **Not an IPS**: By default, it doesn’t block traffic (though it can integrate with firewalls/IPS systems for response actions).

#### **Conclusion**

Zeek is best classified as a **hybrid of a packet analyzer and network IDS**, with a strong emphasis on **NSM**. If forced to choose between **packet analyzer** and **network IDS**, Zeek can be categorized as a **network IDS**—but with a critical caveat:

#### **Why Network IDS?**

* **Primary Purpose**: Zeek is designed for _security monitoring_, not just packet inspection. It focuses on detecting malicious activity (e.g., C2 traffic, protocol anomalies, data exfiltration) rather than simply dissecting packets.
* **Output**: It generates security-relevant logs (e.g., `http.log`, `conn.log`, `dns.log`) tailored for threat analysis, unlike raw packet tools (e.g., Wireshark).
* **Behavioral Detection**: It can identify suspicious patterns (e.g., unusual HTTP headers, DNS tunneling) without relying solely on signatures (a hallmark of IDS).

#### **Why "Packet Analyzer" Doesn’t Fully Fit**

* **Beyond Packets**: Zeek doesn’t just capture/display packets—it reconstructs sessions, normalizes protocols, and enriches data with context (e.g., extracting files from SMTP).
* **Higher Abstraction**: Tools like Wireshark/Tcpdump are for _network engineers_; Zeek is for _security analysts_.

#### **Key Distinction**

* **Wireshark** = "What’s in this packet?"
* **Zeek** = "Is this traffic malicious or abnormal?"

### Zeek vs. traditional monitoring tools

Zeek is dominant in network visibility—it has the capability to provide deep, protocol-aware monitoring and logging of network activity. Zeek focuses on analyzing network traffic at the application layer, generating structured logs that answer:

* **Who** is communicating? (IPs, devices, users)
* **What** are they doing? (HTTP requests, DNS queries, SSL certificates, SSH logins, etc.)
* **When/Where/How** is it happening? (Timestamps, geolocation, protocol behavior)

Unlike tools that just alert on threats (e.g., Snort/Suricata), Zeek **records everything** in a way that’s useful for:

* **Forensics** (e.g., "What files were downloaded over HTTP?")
* **Threat hunting** (e.g., "Find all DNS queries to known malicious domains")
* **Behavioral analysis** (e.g., "Detect unusual SSH login patterns")

**Zeek vs. Traditional Monitoring Tools**

| **Aspect**        | **Zeek**                                | **Traditional Network Monitoring** (e.g., Nagios, PRTG, Zabbix) |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Focus** | Security-relevant network activity      | Availability, bandwidth, latency, uptime                        |
| **Data Output**   | Logs (e.g., `conn.log`, `http.log`)     | Metrics (e.g., throughput, packet loss, jitter)                 |
| **Use Case**      | Threat detection, forensics, compliance | Network health, SLA monitoring                                  |
| **Protocols**     | Deep parsing (HTTP, DNS, SSL, etc.)     | SNMP, NetFlow, ICMP                                             |
| **Tool Examples** | Suricata (for comparison)               | Cacti, SmokePing, SolarWinds                                    |

**Why Zeek Isn’t a Traditional IPS**

* **No Real-Time Blocking**: Zeek logs and alerts but doesn’t actively drop packets (unlike Suricata in IPS mode).
* **Passive Analysis**: It reconstructs sessions and extracts metadata but doesn’t manipulate traffic.
* **Flexible, Not Prescriptive**: You define what to log (e.g., "all HTTP User-Agent strings"), rather than relying on fixed rules.

**Example of Zeek’s Visibility**

A single HTTPS connection generates logs with:

* **SSL/TLS details** (certificate issuer, cipher suites)
* **Timing/duration** of the session
* **Associated DNS query** that resolved the domain
* **Linked files** (e.g., downloaded executables)

This is invaluable for detecting:

* **Malware C2 channels** (e.g., unusual SSL certs)
* **Data exfiltration** (e.g., large, unexpected uploads)
* **Policy violations** (e.g., unauthorized cloud services).

**When to Pair Zeek with Other Tools**

* **For IPS**: Combine Zeek with **Suricata** (blocking) + **Wazuh** (host-level correlation).
* **For Dashboards**: Pipe Zeek logs to **Elasticsearch + Kibana** or **Splunk**.
* **For Performance Monitoring**: Use **NetFlow** (pmacct) or **SNMP**.

Zeek offers **deep protocol-level visibility** by analyzing raw network traffic and generating structured logs (e.g., HTTP requests, DNS queries, SSL certificates), enabling detailed forensic investigations and behavioral analysis—unlike traditional monitoring tools that focus only on performance metrics (bandwidth, uptime). Zeek passively reconstructs network activity into actionable security data without blocking traffic.
