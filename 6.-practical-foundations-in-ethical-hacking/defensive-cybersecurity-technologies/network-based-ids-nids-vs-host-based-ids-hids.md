# Network-based IDS (NIDS) vs host-based IDS (HIDS)

Both **Suricata** and **Wazuh** can function as **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**, but they operate in different ways, and only **Wazuh** is primarily considered a **Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)**. Here's why:

#### **1. Wazuh - A Host-Based IDS (HIDS)**

* **Primary Role**: Wazuh is **primarily a HIDS** because it installs an agent on each monitored host to collect security-related data.
* **Key Features**:
  * **Log analysis** (syslog, auth logs, application logs)
  * **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** (detects changes to critical files)
  * **Rootkit & malware detection**
  * **Policy & compliance monitoring** (e.g., CIS benchmarks)
  * **Behavioral analysis** (anomaly detection)
* **Why HIDS?**\
  Wazuh operates at the **host level**, analyzing activities on the endpoint itself (like file changes, user logins, and process anomalies), making it a true **HIDS**.

#### **2. Suricata - Primarily a Network-Based IDS (NIDS)**

* **Primary Role**: Suricata is **primarily a NIDS/NIPS** (Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System) that inspects network traffic for malicious activity.
* **Key Features**:
  * **Deep packet inspection (DPI)**
  * **Signature-based detection** (using rules like Snort/Suricata rules)
  * **Protocol analysis** (HTTP, DNS, TLS, etc.)
  * **Anomaly-based detection** (e.g., detecting DDoS, port scans)
* **Why NIDS?**\
  Suricata **does not** run as an agent on hosts; instead, it monitors **network traffic** (e.g., at a firewall, gateway, or mirrored port). While it can analyze traffic to/from a host, it does not monitor host-level activities like file changes or process behavior.

Hereâ€™s a tabulated comparison of **Suricata** and **Wazuh** in the context of **Host-Based Intrusion Detection (HIDS)** and **Network-Based Intrusion Detection (NIDS)**:

#### **When to Use Each?**

| Scenario                                                        | Recommended Tool                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Monitoring host file changes, user logins, or process anomalies | **Wazuh (HIDS)**                  |
| Inspecting network traffic for malware, exploits, or attacks    | **Suricata (NIDS)**               |
| Needing **both** host and network security                      | **Wazuh + Suricata (Integrated)** |

If you need **host-based intrusion detection**, **Wazuh** is the better choice. If you need **network-level threat detection**, **Suricata** is more suitable. Many security setups use **both** for layered defense (Wazuh for hosts, Suricata for network).
