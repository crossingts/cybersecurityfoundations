# Defensive security vs offensive security

Become familiar with defensive security and offensive security approaches and concepts, including blue teaming, SOC (Security Operations Center), SIRT/CSIRT (Security Incident Response Team/Computer Security Incident Response Team), red teaming, and ethical hacking.

## Topics covered in this section

* **Two key cybersecurity paradigms**
* **Blue teaming**
* **Point 3**

### Two key cybersecurity paradigms

Since a malicious hacker may be an insider or an outsider, an effective cybersecurity defense strategy often necessitates a two-prone approach to security testing: outsider’s attack (more associated with offensive security and black box testing) and insider’s attack (more associated with defensive security and white box testing).&#x20;

**Two key cybersecurity paradigms**

| **Strategy**              | **Offensive Security**                                                                                               | **Defensive Security**                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach**              | Ethical hacking, “hacker powered security” (e.g., HackerOne and Bugcrowd)                                            | Diligence, SDLC/agile security, DevSecOps/security-by-design, best practices, IA (Information Assurance) |
| **Mindset**               | Attacker, adversarial, damage, break, deceive, trick                                                                 | Defender, ally, protect, prevent, mitigate                                                               |
| **Skillsets**             | How to penetrate an information system                                                                               | How to protect an information system (risk assessment/governance skills)                                 |
| **Conflict of Interests** | Less conflict of interests (hired external ethical hackers)                                                          | Conflict of interests (hackers are typically employees)                                                  |
| **Related Paradigms**     | Red teaming                                                                                                          | Hygiene culture, Security culture, blue teaming                                                          |

### Blue teaming

#### **What is the "Blue Team"?**

The **Blue Team** refers to the **defensive security** side of an organization, focused on:

* **Preventing attacks** (hardening systems, patching).
* **Detecting threats** (monitoring, log analysis).
* **Responding to incidents** (containment, forensics).

It’s a **functional concept** (what they do) rather than a formal team name (unlike SOC/CSIRT).

**Key Blue Team Activities:**

* Vulnerability management
* Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
* Threat hunting
* Security tooling (firewalls, SIEM, IDS/IPS)

#### **How Blue Team Relates to SOC/CSIRT/SIRT**

Blue Team is broader concept—it includes roles outside SOC/CSIRT (e.g., security engineers, threat hunters). The Blue Team **encompasses** SOC and CSIRT/SIRT but isn’t a direct replacement for these labels. Think of it like this:&#x20;

| **Team**               | **Is It Part of the Blue Team?** | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SOC**                | ✅ Yes (core component)           | Focuses on operations. Operates tools, monitors alerts 24/7. |
| **CSIRT/SIRT**         | ✅ Yes (specialized unit)         | Focuses on incident response when SOC escalates.             |
| **Vulnerability Mgmt** | ✅ Yes                            | Patches systems to reduce attack surface.                    |

**Analogy:**

* **Blue Team = "Military Defense Forces"** (all defensive roles).
* **SOC = "Radar Operators & Patrol Units"** (constant monitoring).
* **CSIRT = "SWAT Team"** (activated for critical incidents).

#### **Typical Structure in Companies**

**Small/Medium Companies:**

* **"Blue Team" = SOC + IR (no formal CSIRT)**
  * Analysts handle both monitoring and response.

**Large Enterprises:**

* **Blue Team = SOC + CSIRT + Threat Intel + Vulnerability Mgmt**
  * Clear separation of duties.

**Elite/Advanced Orgs (e.g., FAANG):**

* **"Blue Team" = Proactive Defense Unit**
  * Focuses on **threat hunting**, adversary simulation, and custom tooling.

Ethical hacking vs red teaming

#### Ethical hacking vs red teaming organizational position

#### **1. White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers)**

* **Typically Contracted Professionals (but not always):**
  * Many white hat hackers work as **independent consultants** or are employed by **cybersecurity firms** that provide penetration testing, bug bounty hunting, or security audits to multiple clients.
  * Some may also be **full-time employees** of a company, especially in large organizations with dedicated security teams.
* **Common Roles:**
  * **Bug bounty hunters** (freelancers who find vulnerabilities for rewards).
  * **Penetration testers** (hired to simulate attacks).
  * **Security researchers** (may work for firms or independently).

#### **2. Red Teams**

* **Usually Company Employees (but not always):**
  * Red teams are often **internal teams** within an organization tasked with simulating real-world attacks to test defenses.
  * Some companies **outsource red teaming** to specialized firms (making them contracted professionals).
* **Key Difference from White Hats:**
  * Red teams focus on **long-term, adversarial simulations** (like advanced persistent threats), whereas white hats may do shorter-term assessments (like pentests).

#### **General Rule of Thumb**

| Role                 | Typically Employed By             | Focus                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **White Hat Hacker** | External (but sometimes internal) | Pentests, bug bounties, vulnerability research   |
| **Red Team**         | Internal (but sometimes external) | Advanced attack simulations, adversary emulation |

#### **Overlap & Inconsistencies**

* Some **white hats** are employees (e.g., in-house security teams).
* Some **red teams** are external contractors (e.g., hired for a specific engagement).
* **Purple Teams** (a blend of red + blue teams) further blur the lines, as they involve collaboration between attackers and defenders.

#### Ethical hacking vs red teaming cybersecurity activities

#### **Key Similarities:**

* Both involve authorized attempts to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or organizations.
* Both aim to improve security by exposing weaknesses before malicious actors exploit them.
* Both require technical skills in penetration testing, social engineering, and attack simulations.

#### **Key Differences:**

| **Aspect**         | **Ethical Hacking**                         | **Red Teaming**                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**          | Often focuses on specific systems or apps.  | Broader, simulating real-world adversaries (including physical & social attacks). |
| **Objective**      | Find and fix vulnerabilities.               | Test detection & response capabilities (not just tech flaws).                     |
| **Duration**       | Short-term, targeted engagements.           | Longer, multi-phase operations (like espionage).                                  |
| **Stealth**        | May or may not avoid detection.             | Often prioritizes stealth to mimic real attackers.                                |
| **Team Structure** | Usually individual testers or small groups. | Larger, multidisciplinary teams (cyber, physical, social).                        |
| **Reporting**      | Detailed technical remediation guidance.    | Focuses on strategic security gaps & organizational resilience.                   |

#### **When They Overlap:**

* A red team can use ethical hacking techniques (e.g., exploiting a server vulnerability).
* Some ethical hackers perform red teaming if the engagement includes advanced adversary simulation.

### SOC (Security Operations Center)/Blue Teaming

**SOC (Security Operations Center) analysts and engineers are essentially the operational arm of the Blue Team.** However, whether they are **in-house employees or contracted** depends on the organization's structure.

**SOC as the Blue Team (Defenders)**

* **Primary Role:**&#x20;
  * Monitor, detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents.
  * Handle alerts from SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response), firewalls, etc.
  * Perform **threat hunting** (proactively searching for undetected threats).
  * Work closely with **Incident Response (IR)** teams when breaches occur.

#### **In-House vs. Contracted/MSSP SOCs**

| Type                      | Description                                                            | Pros                                                                                               | Cons                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **In-House SOC**          | Employees directly hired by the company.                               | <p>- Better knowledge of internal systems.<br>- Faster coordination with IT/other teams.</p>       | <p>- Expensive to maintain 24/7.<br>- Requires hiring skilled analysts.</p>         |
| **Contracted SOC (MSSP)** | Managed by a third-party **MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider)**. | <p>- Cost-effective (no need for full-time staff).<br>- Access to broader threat intelligence.</p> | <p>- Less familiarity with internal networks.<br>- Possible delays in response.</p> |

**Key Overlaps & Clarifications**

1. **Blue Team ≠ SOC (but SOC is a core part of Blue Team)**
   * The **Blue Team** is a broader concept, including **SOC, Incident Response (IR), vulnerability management, and security hardening teams**.
   * The **SOC is the 24/7 monitoring & initial response unit** within the Blue Team.
2. **Some Companies Have Hybrid Models**
   * Example: A company might have an **in-house SOC for critical systems** but outsource **lower-priority monitoring** to an MSSP.
3. **Contract SOC Analysts (Staff Augmentation)**
   * Some firms hire **temporary SOC analysts** through staffing agencies (neither fully in-house nor full MSSP).

### Key takeaways

**Blue Team ≠ SOC or CSIRT**—it’s the **umbrella** for defensive security.

**SOC is operational** (monitoring), **CSIRT is reactive** (incidents), **Blue Team is cultural/philosophical** (defense-in-depth).

**Not all companies use "Blue Team" as a formal name**—many just say SOC/CSIRT.

**Interchangeability depends on context**:

* In a startup? "Blue Team" might mean 1–2 people doing everything.
* In a bank? "Blue Team" could refer to a 100-person division.
