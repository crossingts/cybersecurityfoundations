### Two key cybersecurity paradigms

Since a malicious hacker may be an insider or an outsider, an effective cybersecurity defense strategy often necessitates a two-prone approach to security testing: outsider’s attack (more associated with offensive security and black box testing) and insider’s attack (more associated with defensive security and white box testing). 

**Two Key Cybersecurity Paradigms**

| **Strategy**              | **Offensive Security**                                                                           | **Defensive Security**                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach**              | Ethical hacking, “hacker powered security” (e.g., HackerOne and Bugcrowd)                        | Diligence, SDLC/agile security, DevSecOps/security-by-design, best practices, IA (Information Assurance) |
| **Mindset**               | Attacker, adversarial, damage, break, deceive, trick                                             | Defender, ally, protect, prevent, mitigate                                                               |
| **Skillsets**             | How to penetrate an information system                                                           | How to protect an information system (risk assessment, risk mitigation, governance skills)               |
| **Conflict of Interests** | Less conflict of interests (hired external ethical hackers)                                      | Conflict of interests (hackers are typically employees)                                                  |
| **Related Paradigms**     | Red teaming                                                                                      | Hygiene culture, security culture, blue teaming                                                          |
| **Permission of Owner**   | Authorized, legal                                                                                | Authorized, legal                                                                                        |
| **Testing Approaches**    | <p>Blackbox testing</p><p></p><p>Third party audit/auditor perspective of infosec governance</p> | White box testing                                                                                        |
| **Authentication**        | Unauthenticated scan (outsider attack)                                                           | Authenticated scan (simulation of insider attack)                                                        |

### Blue teaming core functions

The blue team refers to the defensive security side of an organization. Blue teaming is a functional concept (what they do) rather than a formal team name like SOC and CSIRT. The activities of blue teams focus on preventing attacks, detecting threats, and responding to incidents.

**Summary of Blue Team Activities**

|Core Function|Key Activities & Processes|Primary Security Tools|
|---|---|---|
|**Prevent**|**Vulnerability Management:** Identifying, prioritizing, and remediating software vulnerabilities through systematic patching.  <br>  <br>**System Hardening:** Securing systems by configuring them for maximum security and minimal attack surface (e.g., disabling unused services, enforcing least-privilege access).|Firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)|
|**Detect**|**Continuous Monitoring & Log Analysis:** Actively reviewing logs and security alerts from across the network and systems to identify potential malicious activity.  <br>  <br>**Threat Hunting:** The proactive search for hidden threats or anomalies within the environment, based on hypotheses and intelligence, rather than waiting for alerts.|SIEM, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)|
|**Respond**|**Incident Response:** Containing the impact of a security incident, eradicating the threat, and recovering systems to a known good state.  <br>  <br>**Digital Forensics:** Analyzing systems and artifacts post-incident to determine the root cause, scope of the breach, and attacker tactics.|Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Forensics Tools|

#### **How Blue Team Relates to SOC/CSIRT/SIRT**

Blue Team is broader concept—it includes roles outside SOC/CSIRT (e.g., security engineers, threat hunters). The Blue Team **encompasses** SOC and CSIRT/SIRT but isn’t a direct replacement for these labels. Think of it like this: 

| **Team**               | **Is It Part of the Blue Team?** | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SOC**                | ✅ Yes (core component)           | Focuses on operations. Operates tools, monitors alerts 24/7. |
| **CSIRT/SIRT**         | ✅ Yes (specialized unit)         | Focuses on incident response when SOC escalates.             |
| **Vulnerability Mgmt** | ✅ Yes                            | Patches systems to reduce attack surface.                    |

**Analogy:**

* **Blue Team = "Military Defense Forces"** (all defensive roles).
* **SOC = "Radar Operators & Patrol Units"** (constant monitoring).
* **CSIRT = "SWAT Team"** (activated for critical incidents).

#### **Typical Structure in Companies**

**Small/Medium Companies:**

* **Blue Team = SOC + Incident Response (IR). (No formal CSIRT)**
  * Analysts handle both monitoring and response.

**Large Enterprises:**

* **Blue Team = SOC + CSIRT + Threat Intel + Vulnerability Management**
  * Clear separation of duties.

**Elite/Advanced Orgs (e.g., FAANG):**

* **Blue Team = Proactive Defense Unit**
  * Focuses on **threat hunting**, adversary simulation, and custom tooling.

### SOC (Security Operations Center)

**SOC (Security Operations Center) analysts and engineers are essentially the operational arm of the Blue Team.** However, whether they are **in-house employees or contracted** depends on the organization's structure.

**SOC as the Blue Team (Defenders)**

* **Primary Role:** 
  * Monitor, detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents.
  * Handle alerts from SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response), firewalls, etc.
  * Perform **threat hunting** (proactively searching for undetected threats).
  * Work closely with **Incident Response (IR)** teams when breaches occur.
* **Focus**: Operational security—handling alerts, triaging threats, and performing initial analysis.
* **Tools**: SIEM, EDR/XDR, threat intelligence feeds, and automation.
* **Typical Output**: Alerts, tickets, and initial containment actions.

A SOC is often the first line of defense, working 24/7 to identify and mitigate threats in real time.

#### **In-House vs. Contracted/MSSP SOCs**

| Type                      | Description                                                            | Pros                                                                                               | Cons                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **In-House SOC**          | Employees directly hired by the company.                               | <p>- Better knowledge of internal systems.<br>- Faster coordination with IT/other teams.</p>       | <p>- Expensive to maintain 24/7.<br>- Requires hiring skilled analysts.</p>         |
| **Contracted SOC (MSSP)** | Managed by a third-party **MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider)**. | <p>- Cost-effective (no need for full-time staff).<br>- Access to broader threat intelligence.</p> | <p>- Less familiarity with internal networks.<br>- Possible delays in response.</p> |

**Key Overlaps & Clarifications**

1. **Blue Team ≠ SOC (but SOC is a core part of Blue Team)**
   * The **Blue Team** is a broader concept, including **SOC, Incident Response (IR), vulnerability management, and security hardening teams**.
   * The **SOC is the 24/7 monitoring & initial response unit** within the Blue Team.
2. **Some Companies Have Hybrid Models**
   * Example: A company might have an **in-house SOC for critical systems** but outsource **lower-priority monitoring** to an MSSP.
3. **Contract SOC Analysts (Staff Augmentation)**
   * Some firms hire **temporary SOC analysts** through staffing agencies (neither fully in-house nor full MSSP).

### SIRT/CSIRT (Security Incident Response Team/Computer SIRT)

#### **CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team)**

* **Primary Role**: **Incident response**—investigating, containing, and recovering from confirmed incidents.
* **Focus**: Post-detection actions (forensics, root cause analysis, remediation).
* **Overlap with SOC**: A SOC may escalate confirmed incidents to the CSIRT for deeper analysis.
* **Typical Output**: Incident reports, lessons learned, and coordination with legal/PR.

CSIRTs are more specialized than SOCs and are activated for high-severity incidents (e.g., breaches, ransomware).

#### **SIRT (Security Incident Response Team)**

* **Alternative Name**: Often synonymous with **CSIRT** (some orgs use "SIRT" instead of "CSIRT").
* **Minor Differences**:
  * _SIRT_ might focus on broader security incidents (physical, insider threats).
  * _CSIRT_ is explicitly IT/digital-focused (e.g., malware, hacking).

In practice, the terms are often used interchangeably.

#### How SOC and CSIRT/SIRT Fit Together in Organizations:

* **SOC + CSIRT/SIRT**: Common in larger companies. The SOC handles day-to-day monitoring; the CSIRT/SIRT takes over for serious incidents.
  * Example: SOC detects unusual lateral movement → escalates to CSIRT for investigation.
* **SOC Only**: Some orgs rely solely on a SOC, with analysts handling both detection and response (common in mid-sized companies).
* **CSIRT/SIRT Only**: Rare—usually in orgs that outsource monitoring (MSSP SOC) but keep internal response.

#### Key Differences:

| Feature      | SOC                    | CSIRT/SIRT                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Scope**    | Monitoring & alerting  | Incident investigation             |
| **Activity** | Continuous (24/7)      | On-demand (activated per incident) |
| **Skills**   | Triage, basic analysis | Forensics, malware analysis        |

#### Key Clarifications

* **SOC** = "Security guard" (watches for threats).
* **CSIRT/SIRT** = "SWAT team" (deploys when a major threat is found).
* Many companies have both, but smaller orgs might only have a SOC (or outsource CSIRT functions).

#### **When SOC Handles CSIRT/SIRT Tasks (Without a Dedicated Team)**

1. **SOC Analysts Wear Multiple Hats**
   * Tier 1 SOC: Monitors alerts, performs initial triage.
   * Tier 2/Tier 3 SOC: Acts as de facto **incident responders**—investigating, containing, and remediating incidents (normally CSIRT’s role).
   * Example: A SOC analyst investigates a phishing campaign, traces compromised accounts, and coordinates remediation—all without escalating to a separate CSIRT.
2. **No Formal "CSIRT" Branding**
   * The organization may document incident response processes (e.g., playbooks) but won’t designate a standalone CSIRT.
   * Roles like _"SOC Incident Responder"_ or _"Senior Security Analyst"_ cover CSIRT duties.
3. **Why This Happens**
   * **Cost/Resources**: Maintaining a 24/7 SOC is expensive; adding a separate CSIRT isn’t always justified.
   * **Workflow Simplicity**: Smaller incident volumes may not require a specialized team.
   * **Outsourcing**: Some orgs rely on an **MSSP’s SOC** for monitoring and keep a tiny internal team for response (effectively a mini-CSIRT without the name).

#### **Key Differences: Dedicated CSIRT vs. SOC-Only Approach**

|                    | Dedicated CSIRT/SIRT                    | SOC-Only (With CSIRT Responsibilities)   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Team Structure** | Separate team, often senior specialists | SOC tiers handle end-to-end incidents    |
| **Activation**     | Engaged for major incidents             | SOC escalates internally (no handoff)    |
| **Skills**         | Deep forensics, legal/PR coordination   | SOC analysts trained in basic IR         |
| **Common in**      | Large enterprises, regulated industries | Mid-sized companies, lean security teams |

**When Does a Company **_**Need**_** a Dedicated CSIRT?**

1. **High Incident Volume**: SOC is overwhelmed by false positives and lacks time for deep investigations.
2. **Regulatory Requirements**: Industries like finance/healthcare may mandate a formal IR team.
3. **Complex Attacks**: Advanced threats (APT, ransomware) need specialized skills beyond SOC analysts.

**Hybrid Approach (Common in Growing Companies)**

Some orgs start with a SOC-only model, then evolve:

* **Phase 1**: SOC handles everything.
* **Phase 2**: Senior SOC members are designated as _"IRT leads"_ (still part of SOC).
* **Phase 3**: Formal CSIRT splits off as the security program matures.

Example: A tech startup’s SOC might handle IR until a breach occurs, prompting the creation of a CSIRT.

### Ethical hacking vs red teaming

#### Ethical hacking vs red teaming cybersecurity roles

#### **1. White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers)**

* **Typically Contracted Professionals (but not always):**
  * Many white hat hackers work as **independent consultants** or are employed by **cybersecurity firms** that provide penetration testing, bug bounty hunting, or security audits to multiple clients.
  * Some may also be **full-time employees** of a company, especially in large organizations with dedicated security teams.
* **Common Roles:**
  * **Bug bounty hunters** (freelancers who find vulnerabilities for rewards).
  * **Penetration testers** (hired to simulate attacks).
  * **Security researchers** (may work for firms or independently).

#### **2. Red Teams**

* **Usually Company Employees (but not always):**
  * Red teams are often **internal teams** within an organization tasked with simulating real-world attacks to test defenses.
  * Some companies **outsource red teaming** to specialized firms (making them contracted professionals).
* **Key Difference from White Hats:**
  * Red teams focus on **long-term, adversarial simulations** (like advanced persistent threats), whereas white hats may do shorter-term assessments (like pentests).

#### **General Rule of Thumb**

| Role                 | Typically Employed By             | Focus                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **White Hat Hacker** | External (but sometimes internal) | Pentests, bug bounties, vulnerability research   |
| **Red Team**         | Internal (but sometimes external) | Advanced attack simulations, adversary emulation |

#### **Overlap & Inconsistencies**

* Some **white hats** are employees (e.g., in-house security teams).
* Some **red teams** are external contractors (e.g., hired for a specific engagement).
* **Purple Teams** (a blend of red + blue teams) further blur the lines, as they involve collaboration between attackers and defenders.

#### Ethical hacking vs red teaming cybersecurity activities

#### **Key Similarities:**

* Both involve authorized attempts to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or organizations.
* Both aim to improve security by exposing weaknesses before malicious actors exploit them.
* Both require technical skills in penetration testing, social engineering, and attack simulations.

#### **Key Differences:**

| **Aspect**         | **Ethical Hacking**                         | **Red Teaming**                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**          | Often focuses on specific systems or apps.  | Broader, simulating real-world adversaries (including physical & social attacks). |
| **Objective**      | Find and fix vulnerabilities.               | Test detection & response capabilities (not just tech flaws).                     |
| **Duration**       | Short-term, targeted engagements.           | Longer, multi-phase operations (like espionage).                                  |
| **Stealth**        | May or may not avoid detection.             | Often prioritizes stealth to mimic real attackers.                                |
| **Team Structure** | Usually individual testers or small groups. | Larger, multidisciplinary teams (cyber, physical, social).                        |
| **Reporting**      | Detailed technical remediation guidance.    | Focuses on strategic security gaps & organizational resilience.                   |

#### **When Ethical Hacking and Red Teaming Overlap:**

* A red team can use ethical hacking techniques (e.g., exploiting a server vulnerability).
* Some ethical hackers perform red teaming if the engagement includes advanced adversary simulation.

### Key takeaways

* Blue Team ≠ SOC or CSIRT—it’s the umbrella for defensive security
* SOC is operational (monitoring), CSIRT is reactive (incidents), Blue Team is cultural/philosophical (defense-in-depth)
* Not all companies use "Blue Team" as a formal name—many just say SOC/CSIRT
* Interchangeability depends on context:
  * In a startup? "Blue Team" might mean 1–2 people doing everything
  * In a bank? "Blue Team" could refer to a 100-person division
