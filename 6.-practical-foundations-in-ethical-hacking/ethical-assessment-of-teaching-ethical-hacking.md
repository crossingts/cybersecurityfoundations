# Ethical assessment of teaching ethical hacking

A set of pragmatic policy statements – recommendations to mitigate the risks of teaching hacking skills to higher education students in computer science and computer engineering disciplines. Three key themes constituting a pragmatic ethical assessment of ethical hacking teaching practices were discussed based on open coding (during data analysis) for Mario Bunge’s (1975) three technoethical rules:

1\) goals and possible side effects (of teaching students hacking skills),

2\) means and goals (of teaching students hacking skills), and

3\) overall value (in terms of efficiency and fairness, representing pragmatic policy statements matching means to goals).

### The ethical case for teaching hacking skills

Technology assessment of using hacking technology in teaching practices helps facilitate rational public policymaking by articulating the ethical and social aspects of technology use in society in a transparent manner. See Table: The ethical case for teaching higher education students hacking skills, and [Table: Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQL_0QJdZq3G7hbsu2M4gIJa2yeXCQ1Sym9ywVjWHIzHk_IZhDp-YzwAxu924upZe137znSZlXeTq9O/pub).

The merits of technology assessments are:\
1\) Addressing societal concerns;\
2\) facilitating compliance with legal and other regulatory requirements (e.g. standards) and ethical standards;\
3\) appealing to public confidence and demonstrating corporate and social responsibility; and\
4\) being a “best-efforts obligation,” constituting evidence of due diligence which can potentially limit liabilities.

| **Society**          | Society has a moral duty to teach students hacking skills to equip them with skills/knowledge to succeed in life and in employment (skills to protect themselves and their future employers).                                                                                                                              | Teaching students hacking skills respects their rights to an education that will help them succeed in life and in employment.          | Society “has an obligation to develop educational and learning opportunities for citizens to develop their full potential” (May, 2012, p. 27).   Students ought to be taught the hacking skills they need to realize their full potential.   | Teaching students hacking skills can reduce crime risk to society and thus produce the greatest amount of good with the least harm.                                                                                                         |
| **Business**         | Businesses have a moral duty to support training students in the use of hacking technologies in collaboration with higher education and government.                                                                                                                                                                        | Businesses need to be able to find and recruit ethical hacking talent with hands-on experience in necessary areas of specialization.   | Business should find channels to help students self-actualize in collaboration with academia and government, e.g., through cybersecurity talent competitions, internships, and scholarships.                                                 | Teaching students the skills the industry needs produces the greatest good and least harm.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Higher education** | Higher education has a moral duty to teach students hacking skills to help them protect themselves and succeed in a professional career; and to produce a growing number of professionals with information management systems security expertise to secure the national digital infrastructure (Sharma & Sefchek, 2007).   | The reputation and financial performance of an institution should not be damaged by bad press.                                         | Higher education should design teaching practices that will help students develop their full potential.                                                                                                                                      | Teaching students hacking skills supports national security efforts and has a net benefit to society.    Students would be able to protect themselves and find work which supports an overall good of supporting national security needs.   |
| **Government**       | The government has a moral duty to support teaching students hacking skills so as to protect the national digital infrastructure and ensure political stability.                                                                                                                                                           | The government needs qualified security talent to safeguard national critical infrastructure and public service institutions.          | The government ought to support efforts to give students the opportunities to achieve self-actualization.                                                                                                                                    | Students should know the cyberthreat landscape and the extent of the politicization of personal communication.                                                                                                                              |

### Pragmatic policy statements

The necessity to teach students the same skills as hackers for effective defence underlies an ethical dilemma for ethical hacking curriculum designers and policymakers – to teach or not to teach students computer hacking skills? There is a need for pragmatism.

A set of pragmatic policy statements were derived by applying STEI-DMG as an integrative approach to risk assessment – by weighing goals (opportunities), possible side effects (risks), and means of teaching students hacking skills from the perspective of key stakeholder groups. See Table: Opportunities and risks of teaching students hacking skills. The pragmatic policy statements constitute implementable policy recommendations to reduce the risk of teaching students hacking skills.
