# Introduction - Practical foundations in ethical hacking

## Chapter 6: Practical foundations in ethical hacking

Ethical hacking is the cornerstone of security verification within organizations. This chapter helps students develop a practical and professional understanding of who are ethical hackers and what they do. This chapter frames penetration testing as professional ethical hacking, a process involving authorized/contractual vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and mitigation.

**This chapter will help students:**

* Contrast professional ethical hacking (authorized/contract-based) with grey hat hacking (unauthorized, but essentially apolitical) and hacktivism (politically motivated).
* Become familiar with the professional ethics of ethical hackers.
* Understand potential benefits and possible risks of ethical hacking.
* Appreciate ethical and legal consequences (e.g., CFAA violations) of unethical hacking.
* Become familiar with defensive security and offensive security approaches, including SIRT/CSIRT (Security Incident Response Team/Computer Security Incident Response Team), SOC (Security Operations Center), red teaming, and ethical hacking.
* Describe common defensive cybersecurity technologies such as packet analyzers (e.g., Wireshark and tcpdump), IDS/IPS (e.g., Suricata and Snort), network security monitoring/SIEM (e.g., Wazuh), and host/network firewalls (e.g., OPNsense, pfilter, and nftables).
* Describe the phases of the penetration testing process (planning, reconnaissance, scanning and enumeration, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting).
* Describe types of penetration testing (network, wireless, web application, physical, social engineering, and cloud).
* Compare black box penetration testing and white box penetration testing methods.
* Become familiar with key penetration testing methodologies (e.g., OSSTMM, NIST SP 800-115, ISSAF, and PTES), frameworks (e.g., OWASP Testing Guide and MITRE ATT\&CK), and technologies (e.g., Nmap, OpenVAS, Metasploit, and Burp Suite).
* Identify common attack targets, including OS vulnerabilities, misconfigurations and default credentials, and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi).
