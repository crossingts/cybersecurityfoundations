# tcpdump: Defensive or offensive?

tcpdump is primarily a defensive technology, but it can also be used in offensive scenarios, depending on the context. Here’s a breakdown:

#### tcpdump Defensive Use Cases

* **Network Monitoring & Troubleshooting**: Administrators use tcpdump to diagnose connectivity issues, analyze traffic patterns, and detect anomalies.
* **Intrusion Detection**: Security teams capture and inspect packets to identify malicious activity (e.g., port scans, DDoS attacks, or unauthorized connections).
* **Forensics & Incident Response**: After a breach, tcpdump logs help reconstruct attack vectors and identify compromised systems.
* **Policy Enforcement**: Verify firewall rules, VPN integrity, and encryption compliance by inspecting traffic.

#### tcpdump Offensive Use Cases

* **Reconnaissance**: Attackers may use tcpdump to sniff unencrypted traffic (e.g., plaintext credentials, sensitive data) on compromised systems.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: If an attacker gains access to a network segment, tcpdump could capture traffic for later analysis.
* **Exploit Development**: Analyzing packet flows to craft exploits (e.g., replay attacks, protocol manipulation).

| **Example Command**  | `tcpdump -i eth0 port 80 -w http_traffic.pcap` (Monitor HTTP traffic)                                                               | `tcpdump -i eth0 -A 'port 21'` (Capture FTP credentials in plaintext)                                                        |

#### **Key Considerations**

* **Ethical & Legal Implications**: Using tcpdump for unauthorized monitoring is illegal (e.g., violating wiretapping laws).
* **Encryption Limits Effectiveness**: Modern encryption (TLS, SSH) reduces the offensive utility of raw packet capture.
* **Commands**: Always use filters (`port`, `host`, `tcpflags`) to narrow captures.

### tcpdump’s defensive use cases with examples

**1. Detecting Intrusions/Malware**

**Purpose**: Identify malicious traffic, such as port scans, brute-force attacks, or command-and-control (C2) communications.

**How tcpdump Helps**

*   **Capture suspicious traffic**:

    sh

    ```
    tcpdump -i eth0 'tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn|tcp-fin) != 0 and not src net 192.168.1.0/24' -w attack.pcap
    ```

    * Flags `SYN/FIN` without normal handshakes may indicate scans.
    * Excludes internal IPs (`192.168.1.0/24`) to focus on external threats.
*   **Detect malware beaconing**:

    sh

    ```
    tcpdump -i eth0 'dst port 53 and udp[10] & 0x80 != 0' -w dns_exfil.pcap
    ```

    * Filters DNS queries (port 53) for potential data exfiltration.

***

**2. Debugging Network Issues**

**Purpose**: Diagnose connectivity problems, latency, or misconfigurations.

**How tcpdump Helps**

*   **Check for dropped packets**:

    sh

    ```
    tcpdump -i eth0 'icmp[icmptype] == icmp-echo' -w ping_test.pcap
    ```

    * Captures ICMP (ping) requests/responses to troubleshoot packet loss.
*   **Analyze HTTP errors**:

    sh

    ```
    tcpdump -i eth0 'port 80 and tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x48545450' -A
    ```

    * Filters HTTP traffic (ASCII `HTTP`) to inspect headers/errors.

***

**3. Forensic Investigations**

**Purpose**: Reconstruct attacks by analyzing captured traffic post-breach.

**How tcpdump Helps**

*   **Extract files from traffic**:

    sh

    ```
    tcpdump -i eth0 'port 80' -w http_forensics.pcap
    ```

    * Use tools like `Wireshark` to extract downloaded files (e.g., malware payloads).
*   **Trace attacker IPs**:

    sh

    ```
    tcpdump -nn -r breach.pcap 'src host 10.0.0.5 and dst port 22' | awk '{print $3}' | sort -u
    ```

    * Lists all SSH connection attempts from a suspicious IP.

***

**4. Validating Firewall/VPN Rules**

**Purpose**: Verify if security rules are working as intended.

**How tcpdump Helps**

*   **Test firewall block rules**:

    sh

    ```
    tcpdump -i eth0 'dst port 22 and host 203.0.113.45'
    ```

    * If traffic appears, the firewall isn’t blocking SSH from `203.0.113.45`.
*   **Check VPN encryption**:

    sh

    ```
    tcpdump -i tun0 'ip proto 47' -vv
    ```

    * Captures GRE (protocol 47) traffic to ensure VPN tunnels are encrypted.
