# Wireshark: Defensive or offensive?

Wireshark is primarily a defensive (security monitoring) tool, but it can also be used in offensive security (ethical hacking) scenarios.

**Wireshark Defensive Uses:**

1. **Traffic Analysis for Security Monitoring**
   * Wireshark’s core function is capturing and analyzing network traffic, which is essential for detecting anomalies, intrusions, and malicious activity (e.g., malware C2 traffic, suspicious connections).
   * Security teams use it to inspect packets for signs of attacks (e.g., port scans, unusual protocols, data exfiltration).
2. **Incident Response & Forensics**
   * After a breach, analysts use Wireshark to review packet captures (PCAPs) to understand attack vectors, lateral movement, and data leaks.
   * It helps reconstruct events by examining raw network data.
3. **Network Troubleshooting (Non-Attack Use Cases)**
   * IT admins and defenders use Wireshark to diagnose connectivity issues, misconfigurations, and performance problems—not just security threats.
4. **Passive Tool (No Active Exploitation)**
   * Wireshark doesn’t send packets or exploit vulnerabilities; it only observes traffic. Offensive tools (e.g., Metasploit, Nmap) actively interact with targets.

**Wireshark Offensive Uses (Secondary Role):**

While defensive use is primary, ethical hackers and attackers can leverage Wireshark for:

* **Reconnaissance**: Capturing unencrypted credentials, session tokens, or sensitive data in transit.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Analysis**: Inspecting traffic during red-team engagements (e.g., ARP spoofing attacks).
* **Protocol Reverse-Engineering**: Studying proprietary protocols for vulnerabilities.

However, these offensive uses typically require additional tools (e.g., Ettercap, BetterCAP) to actively manipulate traffic—Wireshark alone is just the analyzer.

Wireshark is **defensive-first** because its primary purpose is monitoring, analysis, and defense. Its core value lies in visibility—whether for protecting or probing a network.

Here’s a concise table summarizing Wireshark’s dual-use capabilities in **defensive (security monitoring)** and **offensive (ethical hacking)** contexts:

| **Tool Interaction** | Used alongside SIEMs, IDS/IPS (e.g., Snort), and firewalls.                                                                                          | Paired with exploitation tools (e.g., Metasploit, Responder).                                                                                |
