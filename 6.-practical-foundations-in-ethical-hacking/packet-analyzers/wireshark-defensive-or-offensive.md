# Wireshark: Defensive or offensive?

Wireshark is primarily a defensive (security monitoring) tool, but it can also be used in offensive security (ethical hacking) scenarios.

**Wireshark Defensive Uses:**

1. **Traffic Analysis for Security Monitoring**
   * Wireshark’s core function is capturing and analyzing network traffic, which is essential for detecting anomalies, intrusions, and malicious activity (e.g., malware C2 traffic, suspicious connections).
   * Security teams use it to inspect packets for signs of attacks (e.g., port scans, unusual protocols, data exfiltration).
2. **Incident Response & Forensics**
   * After a breach, analysts use Wireshark to review packet captures (PCAPs) to understand attack vectors, lateral movement, and data leaks.
   * It helps reconstruct events by examining raw network data.
1. **Network Troubleshooting**
   * IT admins and defenders use Wireshark to diagnose connectivity issues, misconfigurations, and performance problems—not just security threats.
4. **Passive Tool (No Active Exploitation)**
   * Wireshark doesn’t send packets or exploit vulnerabilities; it only observes traffic. Offensive tools (e.g., Metasploit, Nmap) actively interact with targets.

**Wireshark Offensive Uses (Secondary Role):**

While defensive use is primary, ethical hackers and attackers can leverage Wireshark for:

* **Reconnaissance**: Capturing unencrypted credentials, session tokens, or sensitive data in transit.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Analysis**: Inspecting traffic during red-team engagements (e.g., ARP spoofing attacks).
* **Protocol Reverse-Engineering**: Studying proprietary protocols for vulnerabilities.

However, these offensive uses typically require additional tools (e.g., Ettercap, BetterCAP) to actively manipulate traffic—Wireshark alone is just the analyzer.

### **Decryption for TLS/SSL traffic using Wireshark**

Modern encrypted protocols like **TLS (used in HTTPS, VPNs, etc.)** prevent packet analyzers from inspecting payloads by default. However, some tools such as Wireshark can **decrypt TLS/SSL traffic** if provided with the necessary decryption keys.

**What Are The Necessary Decryption Keys?**

* **Pre-master secret key (for RSA-based TLS)**: If you have the server’s private key, Wireshark can decrypt traffic.
* **Session keys (for TLS 1.3 and forward)**: Requires logging the session keys during the handshake (e.g., via `SSLKEYLOGFILE` in browsers).
* **PSK (Pre-Shared Key)**: Used in some VPNs or custom encrypted apps.

**How It Works in Wireshark:**

1. **Configure Wireshark** to use the `SSLKEYLOGFILE` (exported by Chrome/Firefox).
2. **Provide the server’s private key** (if decrypting RSA-based HTTPS).
3. Wireshark **automatically decrypts** TLS traffic in real-time.

**Example Setup:**

sh

```
# Set SSLKEYLOGFILE in Linux/Mac before opening a browser  
export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/tmp/sslkeys.log  
```

Then, in Wireshark:\
`Edit → Preferences → Protocols → TLS → (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename` → Point to `sslkeys.log`.

**Limitations:**

* Decrypts HTTPS traffic only if session keys or private keys are available.
* **Cannot decrypt without keys**: If traffic uses **perfect forward secrecy (PFS)**, you must capture keys live (not retroactively).
* **Not all protocols supported**: Some custom encryption (e.g., proprietary VPNs) may not be decryptable.

Wireshark is **defensive-first** because its primary purpose is monitoring, analysis, and defense. Its core value lies in visibility—whether for protecting or probing a network.

Here’s a concise table summarizing Wireshark’s dual-use capabilities in **defensive (security monitoring)** and **offensive (ethical hacking)** contexts:
