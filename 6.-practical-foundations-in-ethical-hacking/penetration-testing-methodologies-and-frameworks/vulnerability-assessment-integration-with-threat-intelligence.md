# Vulnerability Assessment Integration with Threat Intelligence

**Vulnerability Assessment Integration with Threat Intelligence and Continuous Monitoring**

Modern vulnerability assessments extend beyond point-in-time scans by integrating **threat intelligence feeds** (e.g., MITRE ATT\&CK, CISA KEV) to contextualize findings with active exploits in the wild. For instance, a scan detecting **CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)** gains urgency if threat actors are actively weaponizing it. Automation frameworks like **Tenable.io** or **Qualys VMDR** enable continuous monitoring, correlating scan data with **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) systems to detect post-exploit behaviors. Additionally, **agent-based scanning** (e.g., CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) provides real-time visibility into endpoint vulnerabilities, even on roaming devices.

Emerging techniques include **fuzzing** (e.g., AFL, LibFuzzer) to uncover zero-day vulnerabilities by injecting malformed inputs into APIs or network protocols, and **software composition analysis (SCA)** for identifying vulnerable third-party dependencies (e.g., via **Dependency-Check**). Red teams often supplement automated scans with **manual validation** to eliminate false positives and chain vulnerabilities for exploitability. Ultimately, a robust vulnerability assessment program aligns with **risk management frameworks** (e.g., NIST SP 800-115) to ensure compliance and reduce the organizationâ€™s attack surface iteratively.
