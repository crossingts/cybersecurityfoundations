# Penetration testing technologies

This section discusses major open source penetration testing technologies, specifically, Nmap, OpenVAS, tcpdump, Metasploit, and Burp Suite.

#### **Penetration Testing Technologies: Core Tools and Their Roles**

Penetration testing relies on a suite of specialized tools to identify vulnerabilities, exploit weaknesses, and validate security postures. Among these, **Nmap**, **OpenVAS**, **tcpdump**, **Metasploit**, and **Burp Suite** serve as foundational technologies, each addressing distinct phases of a penetration test—from reconnaissance to exploitation and post-exploitation.

**Nmap: Network Reconnaissance and Enumeration**

Nmap (_Network Mapper_) is the de facto standard for **host discovery**, **port scanning**, and **service enumeration**. Using techniques like SYN scans (`-sS`), OS fingerprinting (`-O`), and version detection (`-sV`), Nmap provides a detailed map of network assets. For example, during the **initial reconnaissance phase**, a pentester might use `nmap -A -T4 192.168.1.0/24` to aggressively scan a subnet, identifying open ports (e.g., SSH on 22, HTTP on 80) and potential attack vectors. Its scripting engine (`--script`) further automates tasks like vulnerability detection (e.g., `http-vuln-cve2021-44228` for Log4j).

**OpenVAS: Vulnerability Assessment**

While Nmap identifies live hosts and services, **OpenVAS** (Greenbone Vulnerability Management) specializes in **deep vulnerability scanning**. It leverages a continuously updated database of **CVEs** and **misconfigurations** to detect weaknesses like unpatched software (e.g., outdated Apache versions), default credentials, or SSL/TLS flaws. For instance, an OpenVAS scan might reveal a Windows host missing MS17-010 patches (EternalBlue), prompting further exploitation with Metasploit. Unlike Nmap’s lightweight scripts, OpenVAS performs **authenticated scans** (with credentials) for higher accuracy, making it critical for compliance audits (e.g., PCI-DSS).

**tcpdump: Traffic Analysis and Forensics**

**tcpdump** provides **packet-level visibility** into network traffic, essential for **debugging attacks** or **monitoring suspicious activity**. During a penetration test, a tester might use `tcpdump -i eth0 port 80 -w http.pcap` to capture HTTP traffic for analysis (e.g., finding cleartext passwords). It’s also invaluable for **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks**—filtering ARP spoofing traffic (`tcpdump arp`) or extracting DNS queries (`port 53`). Unlike GUI tools like Wireshark, tcpdump is lightweight and scriptable, ideal for remote servers or stealthy operations.

**Metasploit: Exploitation and Post-Exploitation**

The **Metasploit Framework** automates exploitation and **post-exploitation workflows**. Its modular design includes **exploits** (e.g., `multi/handler` for reverse shells), **payloads** (e.g., Meterpreter), and **auxiliary modules** (e.g., SMB brute-forcing). For example, after identifying an unpatched SMB service via Nmap, a pentester could deploy `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` to gain a shell. Metasploit’s **post-modules** (e.g., `hashdump`, `mimikatz`) enable lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration, simulating advanced persistent threats (APTs).

**Burp Suite: Web Application Testing**

**Burp Suite** dominates **web app penetration testing**, offering tools like:

* **Proxy** for intercepting/modifying requests (e.g., bypassing client-side validation).
* **Scanner** (Pro) to automate detection of SQLi, XSS, and CSRF.
* **Intruder** for brute-forcing logins or fuzzing endpoints.
* **Repeater** to manually test API vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure direct object references).

For example, Burp can intercept a JWT token, decode it in **Decoder**, and test for algorithm-switching attacks. Its **Collaborator** feature (Pro) helps detect blind SSRF or out-of-band (OOB) vulnerabilities.

**Integration in a Penetration Test**

These tools form a **kill chain**:

1. **Nmap** scouts the network.
2. **OpenVAS** pinpoints vulnerabilities.
3. **tcpdump** monitors traffic during exploits.
4. **Metasploit** delivers payloads.
5. **Burp Suite** tests web apps.

For instance, a tester might:

* Use Nmap to find an exposed WordPress site (`port 80`).
* Run OpenVAS to detect CVE-2022-3590 (SQLi in a plugin).
* Craft an exploit with **Metasploit’s** `wp_admin_shell_upload`.
* Capture session cookies via **Burp Proxy** to hijack an admin account.

**Conclusion**

Mastering these tools requires understanding their **strengths** and **limitations**. Nmap and OpenVAS excel at discovery, while Metasploit and Burp Suite drive exploitation. tcpdump provides low-level insights for advanced attacks. Together, they enable comprehensive security assessments, from **external network scans** to **web app hijacking**, aligning with **CEH** and **OSCP** methodologies.

**Key Takeaway:** A skilled pentester chains these tools strategically, simulating real-world attacks to harden defenses.
