# Pentesting methodologies, frameworks, and technologies

• Become familiar with key penetration testing methodologies (e.g., OSSTMM, NIST SP 800-115, ISSAF, and PTES), frameworks (e.g., OWASP Testing Guide and MITRE ATT\&CK/cyber kill chain), and technologies (e.g., Nmap, OpenVAS, Metasploit, and Burp Suite).

### Common Penetration Testing & Security Assessment Methodologies

Security assessments follow structured methodologies to ensure thorough testing. Below are the **most widely used frameworks**, including **OSSTMM**, and how they compare.

#### 1. OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)

* **Focus:** Scientific, rules-based security testing (not just pentesting).
* **Key Features:**
  * Covers **operational security (OpSec), physical, wireless, networks, and human security**.
  * Uses **RAV (Risk Assessment Values)** for measurable risk scoring.
  * Emphasizes **legal compliance and safety**.
* **Best For:** Comprehensive audits beyond just hacking (e.g., compliance, physical security).

#### 2. OWASP Testing Guide

* **Focus:** Web application security.
* **Key Features:**
  * Detailed checklist for **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities** (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc.).
  * Covers **APIs, serverless, and cloud apps**.
* **Best For:** Web app pentesters, DevSecOps teams.

#### 3. PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)

* **Focus:** Standardized phases for pentesting.
* **7 Phases:**
  1. **Pre-engagement** (Scope, contracts).
  2. **Intelligence Gathering** (Recon).
  3. **Threat Modeling** (Identify attack vectors).
  4. **Vulnerability Analysis** (Scanning).
  5. **Exploitation** (Gaining access).
  6. **Post-Exploitation** (Persistence, pivoting).
  7. **Reporting** (Remediation guidance).
* **Best For:** General pentesting (network, web, cloud).

#### 4. NIST SP 800-115 (Technical Guide to Information Security Testing)

* **Focus:** Aligns with **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.
* **Key Features:**
  * Covers **vulnerability scanning, pentesting, and social engineering**.
  * Used heavily in **government and compliance (e.g., FISMA)**.
* **Best For:** Organizations needing **regulatory compliance**.

#### 5. ISSAF (Information Systems Security Assessment Framework)

* **Focus:** Step-by-step pentesting (older but still referenced).
* **Key Features:**
  * Detailed **exploitation techniques** (now outdated in parts).
  * Covers **network, web apps, and databases**.
* **Best For:** Learning historical pentesting methods.

#### 6. MITRE ATT\&CK-Based Testing

* **Focus:** Emulating **real-world adversary TTPs** (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures).
* **Key Features:**
  * Maps attacks to **threat groups (APT29, Lazarus, etc.)**.
  * Used for **red teaming, purple teaming, and detection engineering**.
* **Best For:** Advanced adversary simulation.

**Which Should You Use?**

* **For compliance?** → **OSSTMM, NIST SP 800-115**
* **For web apps?** → **OWASP Testing Guide**
* **For general pentesting?** → **PTES**
* **For red teaming?** → **MITRE ATT\&CK**

### MITRE ATT\&CK® Framework

**MITRE ATT\&CK®** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a **globally accessible knowledge base** of adversary behaviors, based on real-world cyber threats. It serves as a foundation for **threat intelligence, detection, red teaming, and defense strategies**.

#### 1. What is MITRE ATT\&CK?

* A **structured framework** mapping how attackers operate, from initial access to data exfiltration.
* Used by **security teams, threat hunters, red teams, and SOC analysts** to:
  * Understand attacker **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**.
  * Improve **detection & response** (e.g., SIEM rules, EDR alerts).
  * Conduct **red team exercises** (simulating real attacks).
  * Benchmark security controls (**"How well can we detect Technique X?"**).

#### 2. ATT\&CK Matrices: Breaking Down the Structure

The framework organizes threats into **matrices** for different environments:

| Matrix                 | Focus                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enterprise ATT\&CK** | Covers Windows, Linux, macOS, cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), and networks. |
| **Mobile ATT\&CK**     | Android & iOS threats (e.g., spyware, malicious apps).               |
| **ICS ATT\&CK**        | Industrial Control Systems (OT/SCADA environments).                  |

#### **Core Components:**

1. **Tactics** (The "Why" – Attacker Goals)
   * High-level objectives (e.g., _Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation_).
   * Example: **Lateral Movement** (TA0008).
2. **Techniques** (The "How" – Methods Used)
   * Specific methods attackers use (e.g., _Pass the Hash, Spearphishing, DLL Side-Loading_).
   * Example: **Phishing (T1566)** → Spearphishing Link (T1566.002).
3. **Sub-Techniques** (More Granular Details)
   * Variations of techniques (e.g., _Spearphishing Attachment vs. Link_).
4. **Procedures (Real-World Examples)**
   * How threat groups (e.g., APT29, Lazarus) use these techniques.

#### 3. How Organizations Use MITRE ATT\&CK

**Defensive Use Cases (Blue Team/SOC)**

✔ **Threat Detection** – Map detection rules (SIEM, EDR) to ATT\&CK techniques.\
✔ **Gap Analysis** – "Can we detect **Credential Dumping (T1003)?"**\
✔ **Incident Response** – Investigate breaches using ATT\&CK as a playbook.

#### **Offensive Use Cases (Red Team/Pentesters)**

✔ **Simulate Real Attacks** – Test defenses against known TTPs.\
✔ **Purple Teaming** – Collaborate with defenders to improve detection.

#### **Threat Intelligence**

✔ **Track Threat Actors** – Compare APT groups (e.g., _Russian Cozy Bear uses T1195.002_).

#### 4. Example: Mapping an Attack with ATT\&CK

**Scenario:** Ransomware Attack

1. **Initial Access (TA0001)** → Phishing (T1566).
2. **Execution (TA0002)** → PowerShell (T1059.001).
3. **Persistence (TA0003)** → Registry Run Keys (T1547.001).
4. **Lateral Movement (TA0008)** → Pass the Hash (T1550.002).
5. **Impact (TA0040)** → Data Encrypted for Ransom (T1486).

#### 5. ATT\&CK vs. Other Frameworks

| Framework                            | Purpose                                  | Comparison                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **MITRE ATT\&CK**                    | Describes **how** attacks happen (TTPs). | More granular than Kill Chain. |
| **Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain** | Focuses on **stages** of an attack.      | Less detailed than ATT\&CK.    |
| **NIST CSF**                         | Risk management framework.               | High-level, not TTP-focused.   |

#### 6. Getting Started with ATT\&CK

* **Explore:** [MITRE ATT\&CK Website](https://attack.mitre.org/)
* **Tools:**
  * **ATT\&CK Navigator** (Visualize TTPs).
  * **CALDERA** (Automated adversary simulation).
  * **Atomic Red Team** (Test detections for ATT\&CK techniques).

**Final Takeaway**

MITRE ATT\&CK is the **"encyclopedia of hacking"**—helping defenders understand attackers and build better defenses. Whether you're in **red teaming, threat hunting, or SOC operations**, ATT\&CK is a must-know framework.
