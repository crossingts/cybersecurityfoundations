# Nmap and OpenVAS

**Nmap** is best described as a **network scanning tool**, but it also functions as a **network security auditing and reconnaissance tool**. Here's why:

#### 1. **Primarily a Network Scanner**

* Nmap's core functionality is **host discovery, port scanning, and service/OS detection**.
* It excels at mapping networks, identifying live hosts, and determining what services are running.
* Example commands like `nmap -sS 192.168.1.1` highlight its scanning nature.

#### 2. **Security Testing & Auditing Capabilities**

* While not solely a security tool, Nmap is widely used for **vulnerability assessment and penetration testing**.
* Features like **NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)** allow security-focused scans (e.g., detecting vulnerabilities with `nmap --script vuln`).
* It helps auditors check for misconfigurations (e.g., open ports, outdated services).

#### 3. **Beyond Just Scanning**

* Nmap can also perform **network inventory, monitoring, and troubleshooting**.
* Advanced uses include **firewall evasion, IDS testing, and raw packet manipulation**.

#### **Why Not Just a "Security Tool"?**

* While used heavily in cybersecurity, Nmap is also employed by **sysadmins for routine network management**, making "scanner" a more universal label.
* It doesn’t exploit vulnerabilities (like Metasploit) but provides data for further analysis.

**Best Description:** _Nmap is a powerful open-source network scanner used for discovery, security auditing, and network diagnostics._ This covers its primary role (scanning) while acknowledging its importance in security and administration.

### Using Nmap and OpenVAS in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing

Nmap and OpenVAS serve different but complementary roles in **vulnerability assessment (VA) and penetration testing (PT)**. Here’s a detailed comparison:

***

#### **1. Core Functionality**

| **Feature**                 | **Nmap**                                               | **OpenVAS (now Greenbone Vulnerability Management - GVM)**   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Purpose**         | Network discovery, port scanning, service/OS detection | Full vulnerability scanning and management                   |
| **Vulnerability Detection** | Basic (via NSE scripts)                                | Deep, using a constantly updated database (CVE, OVAL, etc.)  |
| **Automated Exploitation**  | No (only detection)                                    | No (but identifies exploitable vulnerabilities)              |
| **Reporting**               | Basic (text/XML)                                       | Advanced (HTML, PDF, with risk scoring and remediation tips) |

***

#### **2. Vulnerability Assessment (VA)**

**Nmap**

* **Strengths**:
  * Fast network reconnaissance (host discovery, open ports).
  * Can detect **potential vulnerabilities** using **NSE scripts** (e.g., `--script vuln`).
  * Useful for **initial scanning** before deeper VA.
* **Limitations**:
  * No built-in CVE database (relies on manual scripting).
  * Limited to **known service vulnerabilities** (e.g., outdated FTP/SSH versions).

**OpenVAS/GVM**

* **Strengths**:
  * **Comprehensive vulnerability database** (updated daily via NVT feeds).
  * Tests for **thousands of CVEs** (e.g., SQLi, XSS, misconfigurations).
  * Provides **risk scores (CVSS)** and remediation advice.
* **Limitations**:
  * Slower (performs deep scans).
  * Requires more resources (best for scheduled scans).

**Example Use Case**:

* **Nmap**: Quickly find open ports (`nmap -sV 192.168.1.0/24`).
* **OpenVAS**: Scan for **CVE-2023-1234** in a web app (`openvas-cli --target=192.168.1.10`).

***

#### **3. Penetration Testing (PT)**

**Nmap in PT**

* Used for **reconnaissance** (finding attack surfaces).
* Helps with **firewall evasion** (`-f`, `--script firewall-bypass`).
* Can feed data into **Metasploit** (e.g., `db_nmap`).

**OpenVAS in PT**

* **Not an exploitation tool**, but identifies **exploitable weaknesses**.
* Often used **before Metasploit** to find targets.

**PT Workflow Example**:

1. **Nmap** → Find open ports (`nmap -A -T4 target.com`).
2. **OpenVAS** → Deep scan for vulnerabilities (`openvas-scan target.com`).
3. **Metasploit** → Exploit flaws (e.g., `use exploit/multi/http/struts2_code_exec`).

***

#### **4. When to Use Each**

| **Scenario**            | **Nmap**  | **OpenVAS**        |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Quick network mapping   | ✅ Best    | ❌ Overkill         |
| Finding live hosts      | ✅ Fast    | ❌ Slow             |
| Deep vulnerability scan | ❌ Basic   | ✅ Best             |
| Compliance auditing     | ❌ Limited | ✅ (PCI-DSS, HIPAA) |
| Pre-exploitation recon  | ✅ Good    | ✅ Best             |

***

#### **5. Integration**

* **Nmap + OpenVAS**:
  * Use Nmap for **initial scanning**, then OpenVAS for **deep VA**.
  *   Example:

      bash

      ```
      nmap -Pn -p- --open 192.168.1.1-254 -oX targets.xml  
      openvas-cli --import-targets targets.xml  
      ```

***

#### **Final Verdict**

* **Nmap** = **Network scanner + light VA** (best for recon).
* **OpenVAS** = **Full vulnerability assessment** (best for compliance/PT prep).
* **For PT**: Use **both** (Nmap → OpenVAS → Metasploit/Burp Suite).
* Nmap finds the doors; OpenVAS checks if they’re unlocked.&#x20;
