# Passive discovery method

Treurniet (2004) used a proprietary tool developed at DRDC to analyze network traffic in 1999 to investigate whether “the information obtained through active methods may also be obtained by passively listening to traffic.” A network sniffer was “strategically placed on the network and the traffic is examined as it passes by. The behaviour of the traffic can be compared to an established policy for deviations” (p. 2). “Good agreement was found between the test program results and the documented network attributes” showing how passive scanning methods can be used in achieving network awareness without introducing unnecessary traffic (Treurniet, 2004, p. 2).&#x20;

The check mark: the property can usually be found passively.

The \~ mark: the property can sometimes be found passively.

The x mark: the property cannot be found passively.
