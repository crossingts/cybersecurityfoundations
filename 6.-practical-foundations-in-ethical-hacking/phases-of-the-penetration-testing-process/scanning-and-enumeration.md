# Scanning and enumeration

### Scanning for Targets

Scanning is "the process of discovering systems on the network and taking a look at what open ports and applications may be running" (Walker, 2012, p. 86).&#x20;

The steps for a scanning methodology are (Walker, 2012, pp. 86-87):

1. Identify live systems. Something as simple as a ping can provide this. This gives you a list of what’s actually alive on your network subnet.
2. Discover open ports. Once you know which IP addresses are active, find what ports they’re listening on.
3. Identify the OS and services. Banner grabbing and OS fingerprinting will tell you what operating system is on the machines and which services they are running.
4. Scan for vulnerabilities. Perform a more focused look at the vulnerabilities these machines haven’t been patched for yet.&#x20;
