**Recommendation Matrix**

| Your Priority                                                 | Top Recommendation   | Migration Tip                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"I want a professional portfolio for my career."**          | **GitHub**           | Structure each project as a repo. Write in Markdown. Export diagrams as images.                                            |
| **"I want to deeply understand and connect these concepts."** | **Obsidian**         | Start a new vault. Create a note for each project. Use links heavily. Enjoy the graph view.                                |
| **"I want to write tutorials or show live command outputs."** | **Jupyter Notebook** | Use Markdown cells for explanations and code cells for CLI commands (using Python's `subprocess` or simulation libraries). |
| **"I want a clean, visual, and easy-to-organize workspace."** | **Notion**           | Create a "Projects" database. Each project gets a detailed page. Drag and drop your existing content.                      |
