# OPNsense vs Zenarmor

Zenarmor (AI-driven NGFW) and OPNsense are both firewall solutions, but they serve different purposes and have distinct strengths. Here’s a detailed comparison to help you decide which one to use and which is easier to learn.

**1. Overview**

* **OPNsense**
  * A full-featured, open-source firewall & routing platform based on FreeBSD.
  * Offers IDS/IPS (via Suricata or Zeek), VPN (OpenVPN, WireGuard), traffic shaping, and more.
  * Highly customizable with plugins.
* **Zenarmor (Sunny Valley Networks Secure Firewall)**
  * A **layer-7 application firewall** that adds **AI-driven NGFW (Next-Gen Firewall)** capabilities to OPNsense/pfSense.
  * Focuses on **deep application visibility, user/device-based policies, and advanced threat prevention**.
  * Runs as an add-on to OPNsense or as a standalone virtual appliance.

**2. Key Differences**

| Feature                  | OPNsense (Base System)               | Zenarmor (Add-on)                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Firewall Type**        | Traditional (L3/L4)                  | NGFW (L7)                                   |
| **Application Control**  | Limited (via plugins)                | Advanced AI-based                           |
| **User/Device Policies** | Basic (IP-based)                     | Granular (AD/LDAP, user-aware)              |
| **Threat Prevention**    | Suricata (signature-based)           | AI + signatures                             |
| **Reporting**            | Basic logs                           | Rich dashboards & analytics                 |
| **Ease of Use**          | Moderate (Linux/BSD knowledge helps) | Simpler GUI for NGFW features               |
| **Deployment**           | Full firewall OS                     | Add-on to OPNsense/pfSense or standalone VM |

**3. When to Use Which?**

**Use OPNsense if:**

✅ You need a **full firewall/router OS** with VPN, NAT, and basic security.\
✅ You prefer **open-source** with community support.\
✅ You want **flexibility** (supports many plugins like CrowdSec, Sensei).\
✅ You need **advanced networking** (BGP, multi-WAN, VLANs).

**Use Zenarmor if:**

✅ You need **next-gen firewall features** (application filtering, user-aware policies).\
✅ You want **easier L7 filtering** without complex Suricata rules.\
✅ You need **detailed reporting & analytics** (like commercial firewalls).\
✅ You’re already using OPNsense/pfSense and want **enhanced security**.

**4. Which is Easier to Learn?**

* **OPNsense** has a **steeper learning curve** if you’re new to firewalls (similar to pfSense).
  * Requires understanding of networking (NAT, VLANs, firewall rules).
  * More manual configuration for advanced features.
* **Zenarmor** is **easier for NGFW features** (application control, user policies).
  * GUI is more intuitive for application blocking and reporting.
  * Works as a plugin, so you don’t need to replace OPNsense.

**5. Can You Use Both Together?**

**Yes!** Zenarmor is designed to **complement** OPNsense.

* Run OPNsense as the base firewall.
* Add Zenarmor for **L7 filtering, AI threat detection, and user policies**.

**6. Final Recommendation**

| Scenario                                      | Best Choice                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Home/Lab with basic firewall needs**        | OPNsense alone                  |
| **Business needing NGFW features**            | OPNsense + Zenarmor             |
| **Easy-to-use L7 filtering**                  | Zenarmor (standalone or plugin) |
| **Advanced networking (BGP, VPN, multi-WAN)** | OPNsense                        |

**If you’re new to firewalls and just need application control:** Start with **Zenarmor** on top of OPNsense.\
**If you need deep networking control:** Learn **OPNsense first**, then add Zenarmor later.
