# OPNsense

OPNsense is a full-featured, open-source firewall and routing platform based on FreeBSD. It is highly customizable with plugins. It is suitable for protecting entire networks with features like IDS/IPS (via Suricata or Zeek), and VPN (OpenVPN, WireGuard).

OPNsense has a web-based interface and can be used on the x86-64 platform. Along with acting as a firewall, it has traffic shaping, load balancing, captive portal and virtual private network capabilities, and others can be added via plugins. The software also offers next-generation firewall capabilities utilizing Zenarmor, a NGFW plugin developed by OPNsense partner Sunny Valley Networks. (Wikipedia)
