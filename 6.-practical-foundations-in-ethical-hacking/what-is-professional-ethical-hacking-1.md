### Introduction

Ethical hackers use the same tools as malicious hackers but with the strategic end of buttressing a computer system's security.  
While ethical hackers aim principally to achieve risk mitigation, the various other hacker groups hold other priorities for their hacking activities. 

This analysis frames an understanding of professional ethical hackers as white hat hackers who abide by well established and widely accepted industry and government standards, guidelines, and licensing and accreditation requirements regarding what constitutes professional practice.

First, this analysis differentiates white hat hackers from grey hat hackers, black hat hackers, and hacktivists on the basis of **legal practice**.

### Ethical hackers are white hat hackers

Various approaches/perspectives can be used to distinguish between white hat hackers, grey hat hackers, black hat hackers, and hacktivists (see "Other perspectives on hacking/hacker ethics" below). However, we make a comparison differentiating between these four hacker groups and their hacking practices on the logic that there is only one category of white hat hacking: legal hacking. Ethical hackers necessarily fit into the white hat hackers group—there's no ambiguity regrading the legality of their practices. No greyness. 

ISO/IEC 27001: Authorization & Legal Compliance (A.18.1.4) – Testing must be authorized to avoid legal risks (e.g., unauthorized hacking).
IEEE Code of Ethics (General Ethical Framework): Obtain proper authorization before testing (Ethics 3, 4).
EEE Std 802.10-1998 (Interoperable LAN/MAN Security): Though withdrawn in 2006, this standard historically included security testing considerations, emphasizing: Authorized access controls (preventing unauthorized penetration attempts).

Hackers can be divided into a number of groups, some of which “are clearly ethical, others are clearly unethical, and still others exist in a gray area of sorts and whose ethics can be debated”, argues Pashel (2006, p. 197). White hats use their skills “in a manner that most would clearly define as ethical". For example, white hat hackers could be employees who "with permission, attack a company’s network in order to determine weaknesses, and law enforcement and intelligence agents who use their skill in the name of national security or to investigate and solve crimes” (p. 197).

For Bodhani (2013), there is white, black, and a wide range of in-between grey hat hackers “who will search for vulnerable systems and inform the company but will hack without permission” (p. 65). Bodhani (2013) presents 10 types of cyber hackers: White hats, black hats, grey hats, blue hats, elite hacker activist, script kiddies, spy hackers, cyber-terrorists and mobile hackers.

But for Young et al. (2007), 9 of the 10 shades of grey represent variations on the same theme: Illegal hacking. Computer hacking is either fully legal and authorized, or is an illegal activity. Presuming there is more than one type of acceptable hacking can give justification to illegal activity. Hackers often view themselves as modern-day Robin Hoods (Young et al., 2007). This Robin Hood mentality allows hackers “to deceive themselves and view their illegal activities as providing a service for the greater good. It also gives them cause to justify their activities should they be caught engaging in any illegal activities by blaming the victims” (p. 282).

Hacking as an illegal practice “is used most typically to describe a person who accesses computers and information stored on computers without first obtaining permission" (Pashel, 2006, p. 197). Pashel (2006), citing Logan and Clarkson (2005), advances the definition of hacking as accessing a system that one is either not authorized to access or one who accesses a system at a level beyond their authorization.

The practices of professional ethical hackers are governed by a legal framework. Ethical hackers abide by the imperative to obtain permission before attempting to access a computer network (Graves, 2010; Harris, 2021; Palmer, 2001).

While a white hat hacker is “authorised to break into supposedly ‘secure’ computer systems without malicious intent, but with the aim of discovering vulnerabilities in order to bring about improved protection,” a black-hat hacker is “someone who hacks with malicious intent and without authorisation” (Bodhani, 2013, p. 64).

Pike (2013) draws a sharp distinction between white and black hats. A white-hat hacker is defined as “a hacker who is committed to full compliance with legal and regulatory statutes as well as published ethical frameworks that apply to the task at hand.” In contrast, a black-hat hacker is “a hacker who either ignores or intentionally defies legal or regulatory statutes with presumably little interest in ethical frameworks” (p. 69).

Similarly, Palmer's (2001) use of the explicit terms “ethical hacker” and “criminal hacker” places him squarely in the same camp of moral clarity as Pike (2013) and Young et al. (2007)—there is really one type of ethical hacker, the hacker who hacks within a legal framework.

Logan and Clarkson (2005), Palmer (2001), Sharma and Sefchek (2007), Xu, Hu, and Zhang (2013), and Young et al. (2007) all more or less echo Pike’s definition--essentially placing hacking and hackers at either side of the law.

That ethical hacking is a legal practice is hardly a point of contention whether in literature or in the public sphere. But it should be noted, legal does not necessarily equate with ethical. For example, Pashel (2006) and Bodhani (2013) explicitly acknowledge variations of grey hat hacking exist, but they too agree that white hat hacking can be distinguished as being legal and authorized.

The key defining characteristic of ethical hacking in comparison to other hacking practices is the legal imperative: ethical hacking is unambiguously legal. The practices of ethical hackers are governed by a legal framework. Ethical hackers have authorization to hack the target system (Graves, 2010; Palmer, 2001). Ethical hackers need prior authorization, stipulated in a legally binding contract with the computer network owners, before attempting to breach a computer network (Bodhani, 2013; Palmer, 2001; Young, Lixuan, & Prybutok, 2007).

### Ethical hackers abide by professional code of ethics

2-ACM code of ethics...

**conventional** professional codes of ethical conduct (professional ethical values) can be discussed under the heading/concept of
**Ethical hackers are trustworthy** (don't damage client system; report any damage)

**Professional ethics of ethical hackers**

Professional ethical hackers are bound by a web of codes that govern their behavior, ensuring their work aligns with legal and societal expectations. These standards are enforced through accreditation, certification bodies, and legal systems. By adhering to these principles, ethical hackers maintain the trust of clients, the public, and the broader cybersecurity community, distinguishing themselves as true professionals in a field where the line between black and white can sometimes blur.

#### Professionalism as grounded in university training

Three Canadian university professors of computer science disciplines interviewed for a PhD thesis said professionalism, as in professional ethics or a professional code of conduct, guides the behavior of professional engineers and computer scientists (PPT11, PPT3, PPT10).

As a professional engineer, said a Canadian university professor of computer science and software engineering (PPT3), he is “bound by a number of codes of practice, of ethics.” “As a professional engineer, I’m bound by the PEO code of ethics … I’m also bound by the software engineering code of ethics, the ACM code of ethics, the IEEE code of ethics, because I’m members of multiple societies that have codes.” He says he teaches “five different codes of ethics. They are all broadly the same, but I teach about them to students.” PPT3 added:

That is in the course calendar descriptions and it’s also in our accreditation. We are accredited by CIPS, the Canadian Information Processing Society, and by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board, and both of those require us to teach students about ethics.

Accreditation bodies like the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) and Canadian Information Processing Society (CIPS) require ethics education as part of degree programs. This means students learn not only technical penetration testing skills but also how to apply ethical decision-making in real-world scenarios. For example, coursework may include case studies on responsible disclosure dilemmas or discussions on legal consequences of unauthorized testing, reinforcing that ethical hacking is not just about technical skill but professional responsibility.

Ethical hacking curricula should include the ethical and legal consequences of misusing hacking skills learned in university as a prevention component integrated with the technical instruction (Logan & Clarkson, 2005; Pashel, 2006).

Adhering to multiple overlapping ethical guidelines, all of which reinforce the same core values, ensures that ethical hackers do not merely rely on personal judgment but follow institutionalized best practices that have been refined over decades. 
University programs teaching ethical hacking incorporate these professional codes into their curricula to ensure graduates enter the field with a strong ethical foundation.

Key assumptions involved in this perspective is that university instruction equips students with ethical, scientific, and critical thinking skills necessary for professionalism on the job.

It’s kind of like when software engineering became an engineering discipline. There were a lot of coders that knew how to code, but they didn’t have the mindset to approach it as a systematic large problem. I think ethical hacking is a very similar thing. (PPT11)

PPT11 adds, ethical hacking “has become more of an engineering type of discipline now. There’s structure, there’s rigor, there’s tools out there that can be used for it … you need to systematically approach a problem, how to see if you can penetrate a system or not.” It is “that systematic nature that most of the underground ethical hackers, or the small people, don’t have because they’ve never had exposure to doing it in kind of an engineering mindset.”

#### Professionalism as grounded in industry standards

Professional ethical hackers operate under strict ethical guidelines to ensure their actions remain legal, responsible, and beneficial to cybersecurity. Unlike malicious hackers, they adhere to formalized codes of conduct, often outlined by organizations such as the EC-Council (International Council of E-Commerce Consultants), Offensive Security, and (ISC)². These frameworks emphasize principles like authorization, confidentiality, and non-maleficence (avoiding harm).

A Certified Ethical Hacker (EC-Council) is, “a skilled professional who understands and knows how to look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems and uses the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker, but in a lawful and legitimate manner to assess the security posture of the target system(s).” In contrast to a cracker, who is a malicious hacker, an ethical hacker “is someone who employs the same tools and techniques a criminal might use, with the customer’s full support and approval, to help secure a network or system” (Walker, 2017, p. 29).

**Key Codes of Conduct for Information Security Professionals (Adapted from Thomas et al., 2018, pp. 5-6)**

TABLE


**Key Codes Governing Ethical Hackers:**

- **ACM Code of Ethics (2018):** Prioritizes avoiding harm, respecting privacy, and honesty in disclosure.
    
- **IEEE Code of Ethics:** Emphasizes transparency, accountability, and rejecting bribery or conflicts of interest.
    
- **CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) Code of Conduct:** Mandates legal authorization and confidentiality in testing.
    
- **Industry certifications** like **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)** and **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)** include ethics modules to reinforce professional conduct.
    
- **Industry standards/guidelines** such as **OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)** provide guidelines for responsible vulnerability disclosure, ensuring ethical hackers contribute positively to the cybersecurity ecosystem.

formal codes of ethical conduct include 
1-IEEE standards and ethical considerations/frameworks 
2-ACM code of ethics...

1-IEEE standards and ethical considerations/frameworks:

1. IEEE Code of Ethics (General Ethical Framework)
2. IEEE Std 802.10-1998 (Interoperable LAN/MAN Security)
3. IEEE Cybersecurity Initiative & Best Practices

The IEEE Code of Ethics provides broad ethical principles applicable to cybersecurity professionals, including penetration testers: Avoid harming privacy, confidentiality, and system integrity (Ethics 1, 2, 5).
ISO/IEC 27001: Confidentiality (A.8.2.1, A.13.2.1) – Testers must protect sensitive data discovered during testing.

ISO/IEC 27001: Risk Minimization (A.6.1.3) – Testing should avoid disrupting business operations.


ISO/IEC 27001: Non-Disclosure (A.13.2.4) – Findings should not be disclosed without permission.
EEE Cybersecurity Initiative & Best Practices: Responsible Disclosure – IEEE supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure (similar to ISO/IEC 29147).


Ethical hackers operate within a structured framework of professional codes of conduct, which define their responsibilities and ensure accountability. Several professional codes of conduct exist for information security professionals and ethical hackers, applicable to individuals who are members or certified professionals of the respective association. For example,

- Industry certifications: CEH Code of Ethics (EC-Council), OSCP (Offensive Security Code of Conduct), (ISC)² Code of Ethics, ISACA Code of Professional Ethics.
    
- Regulatory/governmental standards/guidelines: NIST SP 800-12 and NIST SP 800-53 touch on broader security and privacy principles, NIST SP 800-115 (Technical Guide to Penetration Testing) emphasizes authorized testing.
    
- Industry standards/guidelines: OSSTMM, ISO/IEC 27001, OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Testing Guide, PCI DSS Penetration Testing Guidance.
    
- Professional associations: ACM Code of Ethics (2018), IEEE standards/guidelines (IEEE Cybersecurity Initiative, IEEE Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) resources), IEEE code of ethics, IEEE code of conduct.
    
- Professional licensing/accreditation bodies: Professional Engineers Ontario (PEO)/PEO code of ethics, Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), Canadian Information Processing Society (CIPS).
    

While different organizations have their own codes, several underlying principles cut through them: protecting the public (or public safety), acting lawfully, acting with integrity, and maintaining trust.

This universality reinforces that ethical hacking is not a subjective practice but one grounded in well-established professional norms. By internalizing these codes, ethical hackers ensure their work enhances cybersecurity without veering into ethically questionable practices. Ultimately, professionalism in ethical hacking is what separates it from malicious hacking, making it a respected and legally defensible discipline.


**Ethical hackers are trustworthy**

Graves (2010) and Palmer (2001) agree on three key attributes of ethical hackers: trust, honouring the integrity of the client’s system, and seeking prior permission from the client. Graves refers to these traits as professional.

First and foremost, ethical hackers “must be completely trustworthy. While testing the security of a client’s systems, the ethical hacker may discover information about the client that should remain secret" (Palmer, 2001, p. 771). During an evaluation, “the ethical hacker often holds the ‘keys to the company,’ and therefore must be trusted to exercise tight control over any information about a target that could be misused” (Palmer, 2001, p. 771).

According to EC-Council (International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants), an ethical hacker is “an individual who is usually employed with the organization and who can be trusted to undertake an attempt to penetrate networks and/or computer systems using the same methods and techniques as a Hacker.”

Ethical hacking is typically designed to simulate real-world attacks. The ethical hacker will use the same techniques and tools of malicious hackers, target the same information and infrastructure assets, and hence might expose confidential information and even might unwillingly damage assets or disrupt the infrastructure (Harris, 2021; Palmer, 2001).

Ethical hackers hold a unique position of trust, as their work involves accessing sensitive systems that could be exploited if mishandled. Ethical hackers can be trusted not to exploit findings for personal gain or malicious purposes. Further, they will report discovered vulnerabilities privately to the organization, not publicly disclose them without the client's explicit consent.

One rule that IBM’s ethical hacking effort had from the very beginning was that we would not hire ex-hackers. While some will argue that only a “real hacker” would have the skill to actually do the work, we feel that the requirement for absolute trust eliminated such candidates. (Palmer, 2001, p. 772)

Harper et al. (2011) are an important authority on what constitutes ethical hacking. We do not have to agree with them wholeheartedly, but their conception of ethical hackers underscores the centrality of trust in ethical hacking practices. The title of their book, _Gray Hat Hacking: The Ethical Hacker’s Handbook_, is a giveaway to their view, which is that ethical hackers are in fact grey hat hackers by necessity, by virtue of their practices.

Many times, while the ethical hacker is carrying out her procedures to gain total control of the network, she will pick up significant trophies along the way. These trophies can include the CEO’s passwords, company trade-secret documentation, administrative passwords to all border routers, documents marked “confidential” held on the CFO’s and CIO’s laptops, or the combination to the company vault. The reason these trophies are collected along the way is so the decision makers understand the ramifications of these vulnerabilities … as soon as you show the CFO his next year’s projections, or show the CIO all of the blueprints to the next year’s product line, or tell the CEO that his password is “IAmWearingPanties,” they will all want to learn more about the importance of a firewall and other countermeasures that should be put into place. (Harper et al., 2011, p. 11)

Andrasik (2016), and Thomas et al. (2018) make the same point as do Harper el al. (2011), that ethical hackers will sometimes unavoidably access privileged information. Underscoring the importance of trustworthiness, Andrasik (2016) proposes that organizations hiring ethical hackers need to talk to references first:

If a pen-test group is going to actively try to breach your defenses, you want to know their ethics are beyond reproach. That knowledge should come from somewhere other than a well-crafted website or canned testimonials— it should come from conversations with companies that have experienced a pen test by the group in question.

Thomas et al. (2018) argue that "to be effective, ethical hacking involves trying to gain access to a system to access confidential and sensitive information. This means, that a certain level of trust needs to be established between the ethical hacker and the party engaging them” (p. 3).

The authors point out a fact highlighting an intrinsic grey area in the ethical hacking profession and which emphasizes the need for ethical hackers to espouse a strong moral standing.

[A]n ethical hacker needs to keep their knowledge of exploits up to date, and they will likely need to go “underground” to gain this knowledge (Conran 2014). Because ethical hackers may even utilize questionable means to gain intelligence it may result in a question of their professional ethics. (Thomas et al., 2018, p. 4)

Ethical hackers should take “all precautions to do no harm to their systems during a pen test” (Graves, 2010, para. 1). An ethical hacker will not damage or harm the test network infrastructure or information assets and will report on and remediate any accidental damage (Graves, 2010).

In the case of computer security, these “tiger teams” or “ethical hackers” would employ the same tools and techniques as the intruders, but they would neither damage the target systems nor steal information. Instead, they would evaluate the target systems’ security and report back to the owners with the vulnerabilities they found and instructions for how to remedy them. (Palmer, 2001, p. 770)

Research by Tavani (2016) emphasizes the duty of care that ethical hackers owe to organizations and end-users. This includes avoiding unnecessary disruptions (e.g., crashing production servers) and ensuring that discovered vulnerabilities are not leaked to malicious actors. Additionally, ethical hackers must avoid conflicts of interest—such as working for competing firms without transparency—to maintain professional credibility.

### Ethical perspectives underlying the practices of professional ethical hackers

This section frames an understanding of ethical hacking as professional ethical hacking, thus:

Point 1: ethical hackers are white hat hackers who by definition abide my legal imperatives =legal practice.

Point 2: ethical hackers abide by formal and conventional professional ethical standards and guidelines / are trustworthy (don't damage client system; report any damage) = professionals/'s values - e.g., ACM code of ethics...

Point 3: the strategic teleological goal of (eh as) penetration testing practice is info security risk mitigation, which is a practice of professional ethical hacking/conduct--public safety, prevention

Point 4: the pragmatic goal of (eh as) penetration testing based on the language/idioms of their practitioners (i.e., professional ethical hackers) is testing, which is
knowledge making (scientific inquiry) for improvement/efficiency of defenses and risk mitigation.
While the word "hacking" emphasizes the end goal of the act, defeating a security design, which is utilitarian but not pragmatic (not instrumental for improving efficiency). 
Unregulated or "real hackers" will almost certainly never call their practice penetration testing. 

**Ethical perspectives underlying the practices of professional ethical hackers**

| point | Deontology/rule-based ethics | Utilitarianism/consequentialism | Pragmatism                         |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1     | yes                          |                                 |                                    |
| 2     | yes                          |                                 |                                    |
| 3     | yes                          | yes                             |                                    |
| 4     |                              | yes (hacking)                   | yes (professional ethical hacking) |

### Profiles of hackers

Next, profiles of hackers--an analysis of the four types of hacking/hacker groups classified based on the legality of their practices and their professional conduct.
#### White Hat Hackers: The Ethical Professionals <a href="#ember515" id="ember515"></a>

White hat hackers only hack computer systems or machines with legal authorization to do so (including legal contractual agreements). So whether resident (in-house) employees of a company or hired by a company for security testing, the practices of white hat hackers would be ethical as long as hacking is performed in accordance with agreed upon terms and within the specified authorization parameters. Bug bounty hunters are ethical hackers since they work within this legal contractual framework.

The practices of white hats align with professional codes such as the ACM Code of Ethics (2018), which mandates permission-based hacking (e.g., Principle 2.8: "Access computing and communication resources only when authorized"), the IEEE Code of Ethics, the IEEE Code of Conduct, and the IEEE Cybersecurity Initiative.

White hats operate with explicit client permission and follow well established penetration testing industry and regulatory ethical guidelines (e.g., EC-Council’s CEH, OffSec's OSCP, ISO/IEC 27001, IEEE 802.10, OWASP, and NIST SP 800-115):

* EC-Council’s CEH Code of Ethics (explicit rules for pentesters).
* Offensive Security's OSCP curriculum includes ethics module to reinforce professional conduct.
* ISO/IEC 27001 (includes security testing norms).
* IEEE 802.10 (historical standard for security) and newer frameworks emphasize authorized testing.
* OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) provide guidelines for responsible vulnerability disclosure.
* NIST SP 800-115 (Technical Guide to Penetration Testing) emphasizes authorized testing.

**Key traits of ethical hackers:**

* Operate legally under contracts or employment agreements (Schneier, 2020).
* Follow responsible disclosure practices (ISO/IEC 29147), e.g., report vulnerabilities privately to the vendor.
* Motivated by improving security, not fame or profit.
* Often hold industry certifications like CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) or OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional).
* Compliance with laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (Schneier, 2020).

**Examples:**

1. **Kevin Mitnick (post-reformation)** – Once a notorious black hat, he became a respected cybersecurity consultant and author.
2. **Charlie Miller** – A well-known security researcher who worked for companies like Uber and Cruise Automation, uncovering critical vulnerabilities responsibly.
3. **Troy Hunt** – Creator of _Have I Been Pwned_, a security expert who collaborates with companies to expose data breaches ethically.

#### Grey Hat Hackers: The Unauthorized Researchers <a href="#ember524" id="ember524"></a>

Grey hat hackers fall between white and black hats—they hack computer systems without permission but usually claim altruistic motives (Jordan & Taylor, 2004). They often breach regulations (e.g., CFAA) in the course of discovering security flaws within commercial software—a practice critiqued in literature as "vigilante security" (Denning, 2010). They then notify the software vendor asking it to fix discovered vulnerabilities and threaten public exposure of the vulnerabilities if the vendor does not oblige (sometimes they demand payment). While some may genuinely help improve security, their methods are illegal and ethically questionable. Some call themselves security researchers, but legitimate researchers work within legal frameworks (e.g., ethical hacking consultants).

**Key traits of grey hat hackers:**

* Hack without permission but often claim to act in the public interest.
* May extort companies by threatening to release vulnerabilities.
* Often seek recognition (bragging about exploits on social media or at conferences).
* Some transition into white hat roles, while others drift toward black hat activities.

**Examples:**

1. **Marcus Hutchins (MalwareTech)** – Initially a grey hat hacker, he later became a white hat after stopping the _WannaCry_ ransomware attack.
2. **The Anonymous Researcher Who Leaked iOS Vulnerabilities** – Some grey hats have exposed Apple or Microsoft flaws without authorization, claiming it was for public safety.
3. **Researchers Who Sold Zero-Days** – Some grey hats have sold exploits to companies (or even governments) instead of reporting them responsibly.

#### Black Hat Hackers: The Criminals <a href="#ember530" id="ember530"></a>

Black hat hackers come in two variations. The original/more traditional attribution of the label "black hat hackers" is associated with bad actors who hack for personal profit or for some other criminal goal. The more recent use of the term black hat hacking refers to presumably legal hacking practices whereby hackers have no prior knowledge of the target system (i.e., an attribution based on a technical perspective rather than an ethical perspective). Within our classification scheme, black hats are criminally-minded.

Black hat hackers as criminals engage in illegal hacking for personal gain, sabotage, or espionage (Chandler, 1996). They exploit vulnerabilities to steal data, deploy ransomware, or disrupt systems. Research ties them to organized crime and state-sponsored threats (Rid, 2013), with motivations ranging from financial theft to ideological disruption. Unlike white hats, they have no ethical constraints and often work within organized cybercrime syndicates or are rogue intelligence operatives. Their activities include identity theft, financial fraud, and espionage.

**Key traits of black hat hackers:**

* Operate purely for personal profit or destruction.
* Use malware, phishing, and zero-day exploits maliciously.
* Often work in underground forums (e.g., Dark Web markets).
* May be state-sponsored (e.g., hacking for governments).

**Examples:**

1. **Albert Gonzalez** – Mastermind behind the _TJX and Heartland Payment Systems_ breaches, stealing millions of credit card details.
2. **Evgeniy Bogachev** – Creator of the _Zeus_ banking Trojan, responsible for stealing over $100 million.
3. **The Lazarus Group** – A North Korean state-sponsored hacking group behind the _Sony Pictures hack_ and _WannaCry_.

#### Hacktivists: The Politically Motivated Hackers <a href="#ember537" id="ember537"></a>

Hacktivists leverage cyber techniques for political or social causes, blurring the line between activism and cybercrime (Samuel, 2004). While some actions (e.g., DDoS attacks) are illegal, their goals distinguish them from profit-driven black hats (Coleman, 2014). Unlike black hats, they are not primarily motivated by money but by ideology. Their targets include governments, corporations, or organizations they oppose. Tactics include DDoS attacks, website defacements, and data leaks.

**Key traits of hacktivists:**

* Motivated by political/social causes (e.g., human rights, anti-censorship).
* May work in collectives (e.g., _Anonymous_).
* May blur the line between activism and cybercrime.

**Examples:**

1. **Anonymous** – Known for attacks on Sony (2011), the Church of Scientology, and governments in support of free speech.
2. **WikiLeaks Supporters** – Hackers who targeted institutions to expose classified documents (e.g., _Chelsea Manning leaks_).
3. **Phineas Fisher** – A hacktivist who breached _Hacking Team_ and _Gamma Group_, exposing surveillance tools sold to oppressive regimes.

#### Hacker Profiles <a href="#ember543" id="ember543"></a>

| Type           | Legal? | Motivation              | Methods                             | Examples                        |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **White Hat**  | ✅ Yes  | Improve security        | Authorized pentesting, bug bounties | Kevin Mitnick, Troy Hunt        |
| **Grey Hat**   | ❌ No   | Fame, forced fixes      | Unauthorized hacking, extortion     | Marcus Hutchins, iOS exploiters |
| **Black Hat**  | ❌ No   | Profit, destruction     | Malware, fraud, ransomware          | Albert Gonzalez, Lazarus Group  |
| **Hacktivist** | ❌ No   | Political/social change | DDoS, leaks, defacements            | Anonymous, Phineas Fisher       |

Each hacker group has distinct motivations, but the legality of their practices and their moral ethics separate them most clearly. While white hats work within the legal system, grey hats operate in a moral grey zone, black hats are outright criminals, and hacktivists prioritize ideology over law.

#### Other perspectives on hacking/hacker ethics <a href="#ember546" id="ember546"></a>

The pioneering historical work of Steven Levy (1984) on hacker culture and hacker ethic (Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution) presents one of the earliest theorizations of hacker ethic (what hackers thought it meant to be a hacker), particularly in the early decades of computer technology in the 1950s and 1960s. Levy (1984) distilled the hacker ethic into six bullet points:

* Access to computers—and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust authority—promote decentralization.
* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, sex, or position.
* You can create art and beauty on a computer.
* Computers can change your life for the better.

Coleman and Golub (2008) offer an anthropological taxonomy of various hacker ethic (hacker groups) based on idioms and practices. Coleman and Golub (2008) see various hacker ethic as representative of the subjective self. They conceptualize three liberal moral expressions of hackers and hacking (cultural sensibilities or hacker ethics) revealed variably in the context of computer hacking: Cryptofreedom, free and open source software, and the hacker underground (see [Table 14: Profiles of Hackers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQVQ4AWXWyM83aXg5QxKwWkl9Oi8-gfRvUh7WhrMKekgb_I8yph4dTOtQYoXjflUA_6roJD5hWRGUT5/pub)).

### Key takeaways

* Professional ethical hacking is legal (authorized) and contract based
* The practices of ethical hackers align with professional codes such as the ACM Code of Ethics and the IEEE Code of Ethics
* White hats follow well established penetration testing industry and regulatory ethical guidelines such as EC-Council’s CEH and NIST SP 800-115
