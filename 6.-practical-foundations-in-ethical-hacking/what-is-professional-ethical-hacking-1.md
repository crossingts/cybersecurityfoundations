### Introduction

ethical hackers use the same tools as hackers 
ethical hackers are about risk mitigation

First, this analysis differentiates white hat hackers from grey hat hackers, black hat hackers, and hacktivists on the basis of **legal practice**. = regulations.
Next, the analysis frames an understanding of professional ethical hackers as white hat hackers who abide by well established and widely accepted industry, government, and licensing standards + guidelines regarding what constitutes professional conduct.
/formal professional ethics and ethical guidelines
= **ethical practice**.

This section frames an understanding of ethical hacking as professional ethical hacking, thus:

Point 1: ethical hackers are white hat hackers who by definition abide my legal imperatives =legal practice.

Point 2: ethical hackers abide by formal ethical standards and guidelines / are trustworthy (don't damage client system; report any damage) = professionals/'s values industry + gov't = professional ethical practice/conduct.

Point 3: the strategic teleological goal of (eh as) penetration testing practice is infosec risk mitigation, which is a practice of professional ethical hacking/conduct--public safety, prevention

Point 4: the pragmatic goal of (eh as) penetration testing based on the language of testing used by the hacking practitioner (i.e., professional ethical hackers) is knowledge making (scientific inquiry) for the more strategic goal of security improvement/efficiency and risk mitigation.

while hacking emphasizes the end goal of the act, which is utilitarian but not pragmatic (not instrumental for improving efficiency). 
Unregulated or "real hackers" will almost certainly never call their practice penetration testing

Various approaches/perspectives can be used to distinguish between white hat hackers, grey hat hackers, black hat hackers, and hacktivists (see "Other perspectives on hacking/hacker ethics" below). However, we make a comparison differentiating between these four hacker groups and their hacking practices on the logic that there is only one category of white hat hacking: legal hacking. Ethical hackers necessarily fit into the white hat hackers group—there's no ambiguity regrading the legality of their practices. No greyness. 

we advance an understanding that professional ethical hacking is white hat hacking performed in accordance with 
well established and widely accepted industry, government, and licensing standards + guidelines regarding what constitutes professional conduct.

First, we make the case that ethical hackers are white hat hackers (ethical hacking is legal).

Next, ethical hackers abide by a professional code of ethics.

### Ethical hackers are white hat hackers

First, we make the case that ethical hackers are white hat hackers (ethical hacking is legal).

ISO/IEC 27001: Authorization & Legal Compliance (A.18.1.4) – Testing must be authorized to avoid legal risks (e.g., unauthorized hacking).

Hackers can be divided into a number of groups, some of which “are clearly ethical, others are clearly unethical, and still others exist in a gray area of sorts and whose ethics can be debated”, argues Pashel (2006, p. 197). White hats use their skills “in a manner that most would clearly define as ethical". For example, white hat hackers could be employees who "with permission, attack a company’s network in order to determine weaknesses, and law enforcement and intelligence agents who use their skill in the name of national security or to investigate and solve crimes” (p. 197).

For Bodhani (2013), there is white, black, and a wide range of in-between grey hat hackers “who will search for vulnerable systems and inform the company but will hack without permission” (p. 65). Bodhani (2013) presents 10 types of cyber hackers: White hats, black hats, grey hats, blue hats, elite hacker activist, script kiddies, spy hackers, cyber-terrorists and mobile hackers.

But for Young et al. (2007), 9 of the 10 shades of grey represent variations on the same theme: Illegal hacking. Computer hacking is either fully legal and authorized, or is an illegal activity. Presuming there is more than one type of acceptable hacking can give justification to illegal activity. Hackers often view themselves as modern-day Robin Hoods (Young et al., 2007). This Robin Hood mentality allows hackers “to deceive themselves and view their illegal activities as providing a service for the greater good. It also gives them cause to justify their activities should they be caught engaging in any illegal activities by blaming the victims” (p. 282).

Hacking as an illegal practice “is used most typically to describe a person who accesses computers and information stored on computers without first obtaining permission" (Pashel, 2006, p. 197). Pashel (2006), citing Logan and Clarkson (2005), advances the definition of hacking as accessing a system that one is either not authorized to access or one who accesses a system at a level beyond their authorization.

The practices of professional ethical hackers are governed by a legal framework. Ethical hackers abide by the imperative to obtain permission before attempting to access a computer network (Graves, 2010; Harris, 2021; Palmer, 2001).

While a white hat hacker is “authorised to break into supposedly ‘secure’ computer systems without malicious intent, but with the aim of discovering vulnerabilities in order to bring about improved protection,” a black-hat hacker is “someone who hacks with malicious intent and without authorisation” (Bodhani, 2013, p. 64).

Pike (2013) draws a sharp distinction between white and black hats. A white-hat hacker is defined as “a hacker who is committed to full compliance with legal and regulatory statutes as well as published ethical frameworks that apply to the task at hand.” In contrast, a black-hat hacker is “a hacker who either ignores or intentionally defies legal or regulatory statutes with presumably little interest in ethical frameworks” (p. 69).

Similarly, Palmer's (2001) use of the explicit terms “ethical hacker” and “criminal hacker” places him squarely in the same camp of moral clarity as Pike (2013) and Young et al. (2007)—there is really one type of ethical hacker, the hacker who hacks within a legal framework.

Logan and Clarkson (2005), Palmer (2001), Sharma and Sefchek (2007), Xu, Hu, and Zhang (2013), and Young et al. (2007) all more or less echo Pike’s definition--essentially placing hacking and hackers at either side of the law.

That ethical hacking is a legal practice is hardly a point of contention whether in literature or in the public sphere. But it should be noted, legal does not necessarily equate with ethical. For example, Pashel (2006) and Bodhani (2013) explicitly acknowledge variations of grey hat hacking exist, but they too agree that white hat hacking can be distinguished as being legal and authorized.

The key defining characteristic of ethical hacking in comparison to other hacking practices is the legal imperative: ethical hacking is unambiguously legal. The practices of ethical hackers are governed by a legal framework. Ethical hackers have authorization to hack the target system (Graves, 2010; Palmer, 2001). Ethical hackers need prior authorization, stipulated in a legally binding contract with the computer network owners, before attempting to breach a computer network (Bodhani, 2013; Palmer, 2001; Young, Lixuan, & Prybutok, 2007).

IEEE Code of Ethics (General Ethical Framework)**

The [**IEEE Code of Ethics**](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html) provides broad ethical principles applicable to cybersecurity professionals, including penetration testers:

- **Avoid harming privacy, confidentiality, and system integrity** (Ethics 1, 2, 5).
    

- **Be honest about security risks and testing limitations** (Ethics 6, 7).
    

- **Obtain proper authorization before testing** (Ethics 3, 4).
    

While not specific to penetration testing, these principles form the **ethical foundation** for security testing.

IEEE Std 802.10-1998 (Interoperable LAN/MAN Security)**

Though outdated (withdrawn in 2006), this standard historically included security testing considerations, emphasizing:

- **Authorized access controls** (preventing unauthorized penetration attempts).
    

- **Security validation** (testing for vulnerabilities in a controlled manner).
    

(Note: This standard is no longer active but influenced later security testing ethics.)

Key Ethical Principles (IEEE-Aligned)

Authorization – Never test without written permission.

Minimal Impact – Avoid disrupting production systems.

Confidentiality – Protect discovered vulnerabilities until fixed.

Competence – Use proven methodologies (e.g., PTES, OSSTMM).


**Ethical hackers are trustworthy**
ISO/IEC 27001: Confidentiality (A.8.2.1, A.13.2.1) – Testers must protect sensitive data discovered during testing.
ISO/IEC 27001: Non-Disclosure (A.13.2.4) – Findings should not be disclosed without permission.
ISO/IEC 27001: Risk Minimization (A.6.1.3) – Testing should avoid disrupting business operations.

### Profiles of hackers

Next, profiles of hackers--an analysis of the four types of hacking/hacker groups classified based on the legality of their practices and their professional conduct.
#### White Hat Hackers: The Ethical Professionals <a href="#ember515" id="ember515"></a>

White hat hackers only hack computer systems or machines with legal authorization to do so (including legal contractual agreements). So whether resident (in-house) employees of a company or hired by a company for security testing, the practices of white hat hackers would be ethical as long as hacking is performed in accordance with agreed upon terms and within the specified authorization parameters. Bug bounty hunters are ethical hackers since they work within this legal contractual framework.

The practices of white hats align with professional codes such as the ACM Code of Ethics (2018), which mandates permission-based hacking (e.g., Principle 2.8: "Access computing and communication resources only when authorized"), the IEEE Code of Ethics, the IEEE Code of Conduct, and the IEEE Cybersecurity Initiative.

White hats operate with explicit client permission and follow well established penetration testing industry and regulatory ethical guidelines (e.g., EC-Council’s CEH, OffSec's OSCP, ISO/IEC 27001, IEEE 802.10, OWASP, and NIST SP 800-115):

* EC-Council’s CEH Code of Ethics (explicit rules for pentesters).
* Offensive Security's OSCP curriculum includes ethics module to reinforce professional conduct.
* ISO/IEC 27001 (includes security testing norms).
* IEEE 802.10 (historical standard for security) and newer frameworks emphasize authorized testing.
* OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) provide guidelines for responsible vulnerability disclosure.
* NIST SP 800-115 (Technical Guide to Penetration Testing) emphasizes authorized testing.

**Key traits of ethical hackers:**

* Operate legally under contracts or employment agreements (Schneier, 2020).
* Follow responsible disclosure practices (ISO/IEC 29147), e.g., report vulnerabilities privately to the vendor.
* Motivated by improving security, not fame or profit.
* Often hold industry certifications like CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) or OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional).
* Compliance with laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (Schneier, 2020).

**Examples:**

1. **Kevin Mitnick (post-reformation)** – Once a notorious black hat, he became a respected cybersecurity consultant and author.
2. **Charlie Miller** – A well-known security researcher who worked for companies like Uber and Cruise Automation, uncovering critical vulnerabilities responsibly.
3. **Troy Hunt** – Creator of _Have I Been Pwned_, a security expert who collaborates with companies to expose data breaches ethically.

#### Grey Hat Hackers: The Unauthorized Researchers <a href="#ember524" id="ember524"></a>

Grey hat hackers fall between white and black hats—they hack computer systems without permission but usually claim altruistic motives (Jordan & Taylor, 2004). They often breach regulations (e.g., CFAA) in the course of discovering security flaws within commercial software—a practice critiqued in literature as "vigilante security" (Denning, 2010). They then notify the software vendor asking it to fix discovered vulnerabilities and threaten public exposure of the vulnerabilities if the vendor does not oblige (sometimes they demand payment). While some may genuinely help improve security, their methods are illegal and ethically questionable. Some call themselves security researchers, but legitimate researchers work within legal frameworks (e.g., ethical hacking consultants).

**Key traits of grey hat hackers:**

* Hack without permission but often claim to act in the public interest.
* May extort companies by threatening to release vulnerabilities.
* Often seek recognition (bragging about exploits on social media or at conferences).
* Some transition into white hat roles, while others drift toward black hat activities.

**Examples:**

1. **Marcus Hutchins (MalwareTech)** – Initially a grey hat hacker, he later became a white hat after stopping the _WannaCry_ ransomware attack.
2. **The Anonymous Researcher Who Leaked iOS Vulnerabilities** – Some grey hats have exposed Apple or Microsoft flaws without authorization, claiming it was for public safety.
3. **Researchers Who Sold Zero-Days** – Some grey hats have sold exploits to companies (or even governments) instead of reporting them responsibly.

#### Black Hat Hackers: The Criminals <a href="#ember530" id="ember530"></a>

Black hat hackers come in two variations. The original/more traditional attribution of the label "black hat hackers" is associated with bad actors who hack for personal profit or for some other criminal goal. The more recent use of the term black hat hacking refers to presumably legal hacking practices whereby hackers have no prior knowledge of the target system (i.e., an attribution based on a technical perspective rather than an ethical perspective). Within our classification scheme, black hats are criminally-minded.

Black hat hackers as criminals engage in illegal hacking for personal gain, sabotage, or espionage (Chandler, 1996). They exploit vulnerabilities to steal data, deploy ransomware, or disrupt systems. Research ties them to organized crime and state-sponsored threats (Rid, 2013), with motivations ranging from financial theft to ideological disruption. Unlike white hats, they have no ethical constraints and often work within organized cybercrime syndicates or are rogue intelligence operatives. Their activities include identity theft, financial fraud, and espionage.

**Key traits of black hat hackers:**

* Operate purely for personal profit or destruction.
* Use malware, phishing, and zero-day exploits maliciously.
* Often work in underground forums (e.g., Dark Web markets).
* May be state-sponsored (e.g., hacking for governments).

**Examples:**

1. **Albert Gonzalez** – Mastermind behind the _TJX and Heartland Payment Systems_ breaches, stealing millions of credit card details.
2. **Evgeniy Bogachev** – Creator of the _Zeus_ banking Trojan, responsible for stealing over $100 million.
3. **The Lazarus Group** – A North Korean state-sponsored hacking group behind the _Sony Pictures hack_ and _WannaCry_.

#### Hacktivists: The Politically Motivated Hackers <a href="#ember537" id="ember537"></a>

Hacktivists leverage cyber techniques for political or social causes, blurring the line between activism and cybercrime (Samuel, 2004). While some actions (e.g., DDoS attacks) are illegal, their goals distinguish them from profit-driven black hats (Coleman, 2014). Unlike black hats, they are not primarily motivated by money but by ideology. Their targets include governments, corporations, or organizations they oppose. Tactics include DDoS attacks, website defacements, and data leaks.

**Key traits of hacktivists:**

* Motivated by political/social causes (e.g., human rights, anti-censorship).
* May work in collectives (e.g., _Anonymous_).
* May blur the line between activism and cybercrime.

**Examples:**

1. **Anonymous** – Known for attacks on Sony (2011), the Church of Scientology, and governments in support of free speech.
2. **WikiLeaks Supporters** – Hackers who targeted institutions to expose classified documents (e.g., _Chelsea Manning leaks_).
3. **Phineas Fisher** – A hacktivist who breached _Hacking Team_ and _Gamma Group_, exposing surveillance tools sold to oppressive regimes.

#### Hacker Profiles <a href="#ember543" id="ember543"></a>

| Type           | Legal? | Motivation              | Methods                             | Examples                        |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **White Hat**  | ✅ Yes  | Improve security        | Authorized pentesting, bug bounties | Kevin Mitnick, Troy Hunt        |
| **Grey Hat**   | ❌ No   | Fame, forced fixes      | Unauthorized hacking, extortion     | Marcus Hutchins, iOS exploiters |
| **Black Hat**  | ❌ No   | Profit, destruction     | Malware, fraud, ransomware          | Albert Gonzalez, Lazarus Group  |
| **Hacktivist** | ❌ No   | Political/social change | DDoS, leaks, defacements            | Anonymous, Phineas Fisher       |

Each hacker group has distinct motivations, but the legality of their practices and their moral ethics separate them most clearly. While white hats work within the legal system, grey hats operate in a moral grey zone, black hats are outright criminals, and hacktivists prioritize ideology over law.

#### Other perspectives on hacking/hacker ethics <a href="#ember546" id="ember546"></a>

The pioneering historical work of Steven Levy (1984) on hacker culture and hacker ethic (Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution) presents one of the earliest theorizations of hacker ethic (what hackers thought it meant to be a hacker), particularly in the early decades of computer technology in the 1950s and 1960s. Levy (1984) distilled the hacker ethic into six bullet points:

* Access to computers—and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust authority—promote decentralization.
* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, sex, or position.
* You can create art and beauty on a computer.
* Computers can change your life for the better.

Coleman and Golub (2008) offer an anthropological taxonomy of various hacker ethic (hacker groups) based on idioms and practices. Coleman and Golub (2008) see various hacker ethic as representative of the subjective self. They conceptualize three liberal moral expressions of hackers and hacking (cultural sensibilities or hacker ethics) revealed variably in the context of computer hacking: Cryptofreedom, free and open source software, and the hacker underground (see [Table 14: Profiles of Hackers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQVQ4AWXWyM83aXg5QxKwWkl9Oi8-gfRvUh7WhrMKekgb_I8yph4dTOtQYoXjflUA_6roJD5hWRGUT5/pub)).

### Key takeaways

* Professional ethical hacking is legal (authorized) and contract based
* The practices of ethical hackers align with professional codes such as the ACM Code of Ethics and the IEEE Code of Ethics
* White hats follow well established penetration testing industry and regulatory ethical guidelines such as EC-Council’s CEH and NIST SP 800-115
