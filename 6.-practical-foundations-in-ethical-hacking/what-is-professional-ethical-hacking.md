# What is professional ethical hacking

• What differentiates white hat hacking (ethical hacking) from gray hat hacking and hacktivism.

• Become familiar with the professional ethics of ethical hackers.

• Evaluate organizational benefits of ethical hacking (risk reduction) vs. risks (e.g., system disruption and privacy concerns).

#### Ethical hacking

There is only one category of ethical hacking, i.e., professional ethical hacking. In this classification, white hat hacking is synonymous with ethical hacking. Ethical hacking is legal (authorized) and contract based.

• Professional ethical hacking is legal

• Ethical hackers are trustworthy

#### Gray hat hacking

Gray hat hacking is unauthorized hacking, but is essentially apolitical.

#### Hacktivism&#x20;

Hacktivisim is politically motivated hacking.

### Introduction

There are many ways distinctions can be made between white hat hackers, gray hat hackers, black hat hackers, and hacktivists. However, I want you to make a comparison differentiating between these four forms of hacking on the logic that:&#x20;

1\) white hat hackers are professional ethical hackers who only hack systems or machines with legal authorization to do so (including legal contractual agreements). So whether resident (in-house) employees of a company or hired by a company for security testing, this would be ethical hacking. Bug bounty hunters, also ethical hackers since they work within the law/contracts.&#x20;

2\) gray hat hackers hack systems or computers to discover vulnerabilities and then inform the hacked entity about the vulnerabilities so that they can fix their commercial software/products or else hackers will publicly disclose the discovered vulnerabilities to shame a software vendor to pressure them to patch the vulnerabilities. However, this category of hackers often end up bragging about their hacking and call themselves security researchers. There are bonafide/legitimate security researchers who work professionally within the scope of authorized hacking.

3\) black hat hackers come in two variations. The original/more traditional attribution of the label "black hat hackers" was given to the bad guys who hack for profit or for some other criminal goal. The more recent adoption of the term black hat hacking refers to presumably legal hacking practices whereby hackers have no prior knowledge of the target security system (i.e., it's based on a technical perspective rather than an ethical perspective).

4\) hacktivists, these hack for political ends.&#x20;

Follows is an analysis of the four types of hacking and the criteria to differentiate between them based on their practices and values.

#### **White Hat Hackers: The Ethical Professionals**

White hat hackers are professional ethical hackers who operate within legal boundaries, conducting security assessments only with explicit authorization from the system owners. They follow strict ethical guidelines and often work as in-house security experts, consultants, or bug bounty hunters. Their primary goal is to improve cybersecurity by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. Unlike gray or black hats, they never disclose vulnerabilities publicly without permission and adhere to contracts and responsible disclosure policies.

* **Key Traits:**
  * Operate legally under contracts or employment agreements.
  * Follow responsible disclosure practices (e.g., report vulnerabilities privately to the vendor).
  * Motivated by improving security, not fame or profit.
  * Often hold certifications like **CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)** or **OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)**.

**Examples:**

1. **Kevin Mitnick (post-reformation)** – Once a notorious black hat, he became a respected cybersecurity consultant and author.
2. **Charlie Miller** – A well-known security researcher who worked for companies like Uber and Cruise Automation, uncovering critical vulnerabilities responsibly.
3. **Troy Hunt** – Creator of _Have I Been Pwned_, a security expert who collaborates with companies to expose data breaches ethically.

#### **Gray Hat Hackers: The Unauthorized "Researchers"**

Gray hat hackers fall between white and black hats—they hack systems without permission but usually claim altruistic motives. They often breach networks to find vulnerabilities, then notify the victim (sometimes demanding payment) or threaten public exposure to force fixes. While some may genuinely help improve security, their methods are illegal and unethical by professional standards. Some call themselves "security researchers," but legitimate researchers work within legal frameworks (e.g., bug bounty programs).

* **Key Traits:**
  * Hack without permission but often claim to act in the public interest.
  * May extort companies by threatening to release vulnerabilities.
  * Often seek recognition (bragging about exploits on social media or at conferences).
  * Some transition into white hat roles, while others drift toward black hat activities.

**Examples:**

1. **Marcus Hutchins (MalwareTech)** – Initially a gray hat hacker, he later became a white hat after stopping the _WannaCry_ ransomware attack.
2. **The Anonymous Researcher Who Leaked iOS Vulnerabilities** – Some gray hats have exposed Apple or Microsoft flaws without authorization, claiming it was for public safety.
3. **Researchers Who Sold Zero-Days** – Some gray hats have sold exploits to companies (or even governments) instead of reporting them responsibly.

#### **Black Hat Hackers: The Criminals**

Black hat hackers engage in illegal hacking for personal gain, sabotage, or malicious intent. They exploit vulnerabilities to steal data, deploy ransomware, or disrupt systems. Unlike white or gray hats, they have no ethical constraints and often work within organized cybercrime syndicates or are rogue intelligence operatives. Their activities include identity theft, financial fraud, and espionage.

* **Key Traits:**
  * Operate purely for profit or destruction.
  * Use malware, phishing, and zero-day exploits maliciously.
  * Often work in underground forums (e.g., Dark Web markets).
  * May be state-sponsored (e.g., hacking for governments).

**Examples:**

1. **Albert Gonzalez** – Mastermind behind the _TJX and Heartland Payment Systems_ breaches, stealing millions of credit card details.
2. **Evgeniy Bogachev** – Creator of the _Zeus_ banking Trojan, responsible for stealing over $100 million.
3. **The Lazarus Group** – A North Korean state-sponsored hacking group behind the _Sony Pictures hack_ and _WannaCry_.

#### **Hacktivists: The Politically Motivated Hackers**

Hacktivists use hacking as a form of protest or to promote political agendas. Unlike black hats, they are not primarily motivated by money but by ideology. Their targets include governments, corporations, or organizations they oppose. Tactics include DDoS attacks, website defacements, and data leaks.

* **Key Traits:**
  * Motivated by political/social causes (e.g., human rights, anti-censorship).
  * May work in collectives (e.g., _Anonymous_).
  * May blur the line between activism and cybercrime.

**Examples:**

1. **Anonymous** – Known for attacks on _Sony, the Church of Scientology, and governments_ in support of free speech.
2. **WikiLeaks Supporters** – Hackers who targeted institutions to expose classified documents (e.g., _Chelsea Manning leaks_).
3. **Phineas Fisher** – A hacktivist who breached _Hacking Team_ and _Gamma Group_, exposing surveillance tools sold to oppressive regimes.

#### **Final Comparison Table**

| Type           | Legal? | Motivation              | Methods                             | Examples                        |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **White Hat**  | ✅ Yes  | Improve security        | Authorized pentesting, bug bounties | Kevin Mitnick, Troy Hunt        |
| **Gray Hat**   | ❌ No   | Fame, forced fixes      | Unauthorized hacking, extortion     | Marcus Hutchins, iOS exploiters |
| **Black Hat**  | ❌ No   | Profit, destruction     | Malware, fraud, ransomware          | Albert Gonzalez, Lazarus Group  |
| **Hacktivist** | ❌ No   | Political/social change | DDoS, leaks, defacements            | Anonymous, Phineas Fisher       |

Each type has distinct motivations and methods, but the legality and ethics separate them most clearly. While white hats work within the system, gray hats operate in a moral gray zone, black hats are outright criminals, and hacktivists prioritize ideology over law.
