# 4.2.1. Professional ethical hacking is legal

The key defining characteristic of ethical hacking in comparison to other hacking practices is the legal imperative: ethical hacking is unambiguously legal.&#x20;

Ethical hackers need prior authorization, stipulated in a legally binding contract with the computer network owners, before attempting to breach a computer network (Bodhani, 2013; Palmer, 2001; Young, Lixuan, & Prybutok, 2007).&#x20;

Much of the discussion around the various hat color codes of hackers revolves around this point. While an ethical hacker is “authorised to break into supposedly ‘secure’ computer systems without malicious intent, but with the aim of discovering vulnerabilities in order to bring about improved protection,” a black-hat hacker is “someone who hacks with malicious intent and without authorisation” (Bodhani, 2013, p. 64). For Bodhani (2013), there is white, black, and a wide range of in-between greys hat hackers “who will search for vulnerable systems and inform the company but will hack without permission” (p. 65).

Bodhani (2013) presents 10 types of cyber hackers: White hats, black hats, grey hats, blue hats, elite hacker activist, script kiddies, spy hackers, cyber-terrorists and mobile hackers.&#x20;

But for Young et al. (2007), 9 of the 10 shades represent variations of the same type: Illegal hacking. Computer hacking is either fully legal and authorized, or is an illegal activity. Presuming there is more than one type of acceptable hacking--authorized access--can give justification to illegal activity. Hackers often view themselves as modern-day Robin Hoods (Young et al., 2007). This Robin Hood mentality allows hackers “to deceive themselves and view their illegal activities as providing a service for the greater good. It also gives them cause to justify their activities should they be caught engaging in any illegal activities by blaming the victims” (p. 282).

The practices of professional ethical hackers are governed by a legal framework (Graves, 2010; Palmer, 2001). Ethical hackers have authorization to hack the target system. In recent years, hacking “is used most typically to describe a person who accesses computers and information stored on computers without first obtaining permission. Logan and Clarkson (2005) support that definition in describing hacking as accessing a system that one is either not authorized to access or one who accesses a system at a level beyond their authorization (Pashel, 2006). Hackers can be divided into a number of groups, some of which “are clearly ethical, others are clearly unethical, and still others exist in a gray area of sorts and whose ethics can be debated” (Pashel, 2006, p. 197). White hats use their ability “in a manner that most would clearly define as ethical. Examples are employees who, with permission, attack a company’s network in order to determine weaknesses, and law enforcement and intelligence agents who use their skill in the name of national security or to investigate and solve crimes.” They have a duty to use their knowledge in such a way as “to benefit other people” (Pashel, 2006, p. 197).&#x20;

Pike (2013) draws a sharp distinction between white and black hats. A white-hat hacker is defined as “a hacker who is committed to full compliance with legal and regulatory statutes as well as published ethical frameworks that apply to the task at hand.” In contrast, a black-hat hacker is “a hacker who either ignores or intentionally defies legal or regulatory statutes with presumably little interest in ethical frameworks” (p. 69). Logan and Clarkson (2005), Pashel (2006), Sharma and Sefchek (2007), Xu, Hu, and Zhang (2013), and Young et al. (2007) all more or less echo Pike’s definition--essentially placing hacking and hackers at either side of the law.

It should be noted, legal does not necessarily equate with ethical. What constitutes legal practice is a political verdict aimed at preserving or reflecting the interests and values of those who drafted or ratified the rules.&#x20;

More importantly, the judicial system and system of litigation give those in power and resources advantage over those with less resources.&#x20;
