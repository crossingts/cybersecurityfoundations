# Copy of What do ethical hackers do?

This section presents a synthesis of ethical hacking practices.

* **Penetration testing**
* **Vulnerability assessment vs penetration testing**
* **Risk assessment**
* **Responsibilities of ethical hackers**

### Penetration testing

Penetration testing is applied in risk assessment and design implementation (verifying the implementation of the recommended security design).

**The penetration testing process** - **discussed in 4.3.1**

* Steps of the penetration testing process
* Open source penetration testing methodologies
* The penetration test report

### Vulnerability assessment vs penetration testing - discussed in 4.2.3. What do ethical hackers do?

Penetration tests have a tightly defined scope and are time sensitive. Their scope is often external systems (outsider's perspective). In comparison, vulnerability assessments typically entail a broader scope and typically do not involve exploitation of discovered weaknesses. Their scope is often both external and internal systems.

**Table 15: Vulnerability Scan and Penetration Test Comparison (Rodger, 2013, p. 49):**

Businesses need to evaluate information security risks for the purposes of insurance underwriting and resource allocation. Several major regulatory frameworks (such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, SSAE 16, FFIEC, and GLBA) require businesses to perform penetration testing and vulnerability scanning periodically.

Vulnerability scans are automated assessments of computers, networks, and applications, and are typically done on an ongoing basis, especially following the installation of new equipment or software. They are typically done by in-house staff, and cost about U.S. $1,200/year plus staff time. Their purpose is detection of exploitable vulnerabilities.

Penetration testing may be done once a year. It identifies what data was compromised (discovers unknown exposures to normal business processes). It is typically done by an independent outside service, costing about U.S. $10K/year. Its purpose is preventive control, used to reduce exposure.

### Risk assessment&#x20;

The goal of risk assessment is “to identify which investments of time and resources will best protect the organization from its most likely and serious threats” (Reynolds, 2012, p. 103). - **Table 10:** Professional Ethical Hackers Coding Table

According to the General Security Risk Assessment Guidelines, ASIS International (2003), the essential components of a risk assessment plan include, identifying assets, specifying loss events (threats), assessing the frequency and impact of events, recommending mitigation options, conducting a cost/benefit analysis, and making decisions.

Risk assessments help risk managers select appropriate control measures or countermeasures to lower the risk to an acceptable level (Engebretson, 2011; Landoll & Landoll, 2005; Peltier, 2005). The concept of reasonable assurance guides the decision making process: managers must use their judgement to ensure that the cost of control does not exceed the system’s benefits or the risks involved. The risk management process “supports executive decision-making, allowing managers and owners to perform their fiduciary responsibility of protecting the assets of their enterprises” (Peltier, 2005, p. 10).

### Responsibilities of ethical hackers

Key responsibilities of ethical hackers include,

* routinely test IT systems looking for flaws (assess vulnerabilities and report them)
* test software/ensure apps are tested
* stay abreast of ransomware and emerging computer viruses
* stay abreast of emerging threats
* compile and track vulnerabilities over time for metrics purposes
* track and disclose vulnerabilities to national repositories (e.g., the National Vulnerability Databases)
