# Ethical hackers are trustworthy

Graves (2010) and Palmer (2001) agree on **three** key attributes of ethical hackers: **trust**, honouring the integrity of the **client’s system**, and seeking prior **permission** from the client. Graves refers to these traits as **professional**.&#x20;

**First** and foremost, ethical hackers “must be completely **trustworthy.** While testing the security of a client’s systems, the ethical hacker may discover information about the client that should remain secret" (Palmer, 2001, p. 771). During an evaluation, “the ethical hacker often holds the ‘keys to the company,’ and therefore must be **trusted** to exercise tight control over any information about a target that could be misused” (Palmer, 2001, p. 771).&#x20;

According to EC-Council (International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants), an ethical hacker is “an individual who is usually employed with the organization and who can be **trusted** to undertake an attempt to penetrate networks and/or computer systems using the same methods and techniques as a Hacker.”&#x20;

Ethical hackers hold a unique position of **trust**, as their work involves accessing sensitive systems that could be exploited if mishandled. Ethical hackers can be trusted not to exploit findings for personal gain or malicious purposes. Further, they will report discovered vulnerabilities privately to the organization, not publicly disclose them without consent.&#x20;

**Second**, ethical hackers should take “all precautions to do no harm to their systems during a pen test” (Graves, 2010, para. 1). An ethical hacker will **not damage or harm the test network infrastructure** or information assets and will report on and **remediate** any accidental damage (Graves, 2010).

In the case of computer security, these “tiger teams” or “ethical hackers” would employ the **same** tools and techniques as the intruders, but they would **neither damage the target systems nor steal information**. Instead, they would evaluate the target systems’ security and report back to the owners with the vulnerabilities they found and instructions for how to **remedy** them. (Palmer, 2001, p. 770)

Research by Tavani (2016) emphasizes the **duty of care** that ethical hackers owe to organizations and end-users. This includes avoiding unnecessary disruptions (e.g., crashing production servers) and ensuring that discovered vulnerabilities are not leaked to malicious actors. Additionally, ethical hackers must avoid conflicts of interest—such as working for competing firms without transparency—to maintain professional credibility.

**Third**, ethical hackers abide by the imperative to obtain **permission** before attempting to access the computer network--the practices of professional ethical hackers are governed by a legal framework (Graves, 2010; Harris, 2021; Palmer, 2001).

Harper et al. (2011) are an important authority on what constitutes ethical hacking. We do not have to agree with them wholeheartedly, but their conception of ethical hackers underscores the centrality of **trust** in ethical hacking practices. The title of their book, _Gray Hat Hacking: The Ethical Hacker’s Handbook_, is a giveaway to their view, which is that ethical hackers are in fact grey hat hackers by necessity, by virtue of their practices.&#x20;

Many times, while the ethical hacker is carrying out her procedures to gain total control of the network, she will pick up significant trophies along the way. These trophies can include the CEO’s passwords, company trade-secret documentation, administrative passwords to all border routers, documents marked “confidential” held on the CFO’s and CIO’s laptops, or the combination to the company vault. The reason these trophies are collected along the way is so the decision makers understand the ramifications of these vulnerabilities … as soon as you show the CFO his next year’s projections, or show the CIO all of the blueprints to the next year’s product line, or tell the CEO that his password is “IAmWearingPanties,” they will all want to learn more about the importance of a firewall and other countermeasures that should be put into place. (Harper et al., 2011, p. 11)

Andrasik (2016), and Thomas et al. (2018) make the same point as do Harper el al. (2011), that ethical hackers will sometimes unavoidably access privileged information. Underscoring the importance of trustworthiness, Andrasik (2016) proposes that organizations hiring ethical hackers need to talk to references first:

If a pen-test group is going to actively try to breach your defenses, you want to know their ethics are beyond reproach. That knowledge should come from somewhere other than a well-crafted website or canned testimonials— it should come from conversations with companies that have experienced a pen test by the group in question.

Thomas et al. (2018) argue that "to be effective, ethical hacking involves trying to gain access to a system to access confidential and sensitive information. This means, that a certain level of **trust** needs to be established between the ethical hacker and the party engaging them” (p. 3).&#x20;

The authors point out a fact highlighting an intrinsic grey area in the ethical hacking profession and which emphasizes the need for ethical hackers to espouse a strong moral character.

an ethical hacker needs to keep their knowledge of exploits up to date, and they will likely need to go “underground” to gain this knowledge (Conran 2014). Because ethical hackers may even utilize questionable means to gain intelligence it may result in a question of their professional ethics. (Thomas et al., 2018, p. 4)
