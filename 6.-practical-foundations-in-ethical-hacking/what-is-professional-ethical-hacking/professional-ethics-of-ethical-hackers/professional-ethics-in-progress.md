# Professional ethics (In Progress)

ISO/IEC **27001** is the international standard for **Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)**, while **ISO/IEC 27002** provides best practice guidelines for security controls.

#### **Professional Code of Conduct Considerations**

While ISO/IEC 27001 does not explicitly define a "code of conduct" for security testers, the following **ethical and professional principles** are implied:

* **Authorization & Legal Compliance (A.18.1.4)** – Testing must be **authorized** to avoid legal risks (e.g., unauthorized hacking).
* **Confidentiality (A.8.2.1, A.13.2.1)** – Testers must protect sensitive data discovered during testing.
* **Non-Disclosure (A.13.2.4)** – Findings should not be disclosed without permission.
* **Competence (A.7.2)** – Testers must have **appropriate skills** (e.g., certified ethical hackers).
* **Risk Minimization (A.6.1.3)** – Testing should avoid disrupting business operations.

***

**Below are the key IEEE standards and ethical considerations related to penetration testing:**

#### **1. IEEE Code of Ethics (General Ethical Framework)**

The [**IEEE Code of Ethics**](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html) provides broad ethical principles applicable to cybersecurity professionals, including penetration testers:

* **Avoid harming privacy, confidentiality, and system integrity** (Ethics 1, 2, 5).
* **Be honest about security risks and testing limitations** (Ethics 6, 7).
* **Obtain proper authorization before testing** (Ethics 3, 4).

While not specific to penetration testing, these principles form the **ethical foundation** for security testing.

***

#### **2. IEEE Std 802.10-1998 (Interoperable LAN/MAN Security)**

Though outdated (withdrawn in 2006), this standard historically included security testing considerations, emphasizing:

* **Authorized access controls** (preventing unauthorized penetration attempts).
* **Security validation** (testing for vulnerabilities in a controlled manner).

(Note: This standard is no longer active but influenced later security testing ethics.)

***

#### **3. IEEE Cybersecurity Initiative & Best Practices**

IEEE provides **guidelines** (though not formal standards) on ethical hacking:

* **Ethical Hacking Education (IEEE CS)** – Encourages certifications like **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)**.
* **Responsible Disclosure** – IEEE supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure (similar to ISO/IEC 29147).

***

#### **4. IEEE P7001 (Standard for Transparency of Autonomous Systems)**

While focused on AI, this draft standard includes **security testing ethics** for autonomous systems:

* **Testing must avoid unintended harm** (e.g., adversarial testing on AI systems).
* **Disclosure of testing methodologies** for accountability.

***

#### **5. IEEE Security & Privacy Workshops**

IEEE conferences (e.g., **IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy**) often publish papers on **ethical penetration testing**, covering:

* **Legal boundaries** (e.g., differences between white-hat vs. black-hat hacking).
* **Informed consent** in red teaming.

***

#### **Comparison with Other Standards**

| Standard/Guideline           | Focus on Pen Testing Ethics?           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **IEEE Code of Ethics**      | General IT ethics (indirectly applies) |
| **ISO/IEC 27001 (A.14.2.8)** | Requires authorized security testing   |
| **NIST SP 800-115**          | Detailed pen testing methodology       |
| **OWASP Testing Guide**      | Best practices for ethical testing     |
| **EC-Council CEH**           | Explicit ethical hacking rules         |

***

#### **Key Ethical Principles (IEEE-Aligned)**

1. **Authorization** – Never test without written permission.
2. **Minimal Impact** – Avoid disrupting production systems.
3. **Confidentiality** – Protect discovered vulnerabilities until fixed.
4. **Competence** – Use proven methodologies (e.g., PTES, OSSTMM).

***

#### **Conclusion**

While **IEEE does not have a dedicated penetration testing standard**, its **Code of Ethics** and cybersecurity initiatives provide a **strong ethical foundation**. For formal methodologies, refer to:

* **NIST SP 800-115** (Technical Guide to Pen Testing)
* **ISO/IEC 27001 (A.14.2.8)**
* **OWASP Testing Guide**
