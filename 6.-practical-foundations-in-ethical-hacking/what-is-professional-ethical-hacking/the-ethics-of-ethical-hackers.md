# The ethics of ethical hackers

The ethics of ethical hackers are discussed here in the context of professionalism/professional practice in society.&#x20;

The ethics and values of professional ethical hackers as discussed here are **based on** research conducted at a Canadian university. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 interview participants in addition to one participant who contributed via email comprised of ethical hacking university experts, ethical hacking industry practitioners, and policy experts. Other data collection methods included organizational document reviews and literature reviews.

Several **codes of conduct** for information security professionals and ethical hackers exit. They are all voluntary and only applicable to individuals who are members or certified professionals of the respective association. The codes of ethics may contain similar directives but they are all different and include different levels of detail.

### Professional ethics

Three interviewed ethical hacking university experts said professionalism, as in professional ethics or a professional code of conduct, guides the behavior of professional engineers and computer scientists (PPT11, PPT3, PPT10). As a professional engineer, says PPT3, he is “bound by a number of codes of practice, of ethics.” “As a professional engineer, I’m bound by the PEO code of ethics … I’m also bound by the software engineering code of ethics, the ACM code of ethics, the IEEE code of ethics, because I’m members of multiple societies that have codes.” PPT3 says he teaches “five different codes of ethics. They are all broadly the same, but I teach about them to students.”

That is in the course calendar descriptions and it’s also in our accreditation. We are accredited by CIPS, the Canadian Information Processing Society, and by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board, and both of those require us to teach students about ethics. (PPT3)

Emphasizing the importance of professional conduct for the industry/business side, PPT11 says, “It’s the professionalism that large organizations are looking for to take you seriously.”

### The social context

This area of ethical hacking instruction pertains to teaching the social science context of technology use and professional practice, and includes the sociopolitical and scientific values underlying the behavior of professional engineers and computer scientists and situating the role of ethical hacking practitioners in historical and theoretical context. The first point pertains to following and teaching the scientific values of society, including a scientific approach to knowledge management – and although not specifically cited by any of the interviewed participants, the second point pertains to teaching the sociopolitical values of society. PPT11 says the way to deal with the “greyness” in the academic discipline of ethical hacking is to teach following scientific values.

It’s kind of like when software engineering became an engineering discipline. There were a lot of coders that knew how to code, but they didn’t have the mindset to approach it as a systematic large problem. I think ethical hacking is a very similar thing. (PPT11)

PPT11 adds, ethical hacking “has become more of an engineering type of discipline now. There’s structure, there’s rigor, there’s tools out there that can be used for it … you need to systematically approach a problem, how to see if you can penetrate a system or not.” It is “that systematic nature that most of the underground ethical hackers, or the small people, don’t have because they’ve never had exposure to doing it in kind of an engineering mindset.”

#### Sociopolitical and scientific values

Sociopolitical and scientific values underlying the behavior of professional ethical hackers

Discussion of social values: Canadian identity as an academic idea.\
The key social values are liberalism (classical liberalism), pragmatic ethics, knowledge making (Weick’s constructivism), and scientific (pragmatic philosophy).

Discussion of pragmatic ethics: The technoethics of Mario Bunge.\
Bunge’s (1975) pragmatic technoethics serves as an overarching framework guiding the application of key societal normative ethical perspectives – deontology (duty), rights, virtue, and utilitarianism.

Discussion of key societal normative ethics: Ethical decision-making theories: Introduction to normative ethics.

Discussion of social scientific values: Scientific method in research.\
Canadian society can be defined by two key scientific values that define it as a secular and trusting society, critical rationalism and pragmatism.
