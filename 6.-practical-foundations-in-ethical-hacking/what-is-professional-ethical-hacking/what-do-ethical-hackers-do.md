# What do ethical hackers do - highlights

PhD thesis section: 4.2.3. What do ethical hackers do?

Defined from within the information security field the term ethical hacking most formally refers to penetration testing practices, and less formally to vulnerability assessment and risk assessment processes.&#x20;

The core work of professional ethical hackers involves performing security assessments or security audits and their cybersecurity role in organizations can be seen as “analysts” collecting and analyzing threat and vulnerability data and giving actionable recommendations to mitigate any vulnerabilities and security risks.

Key practices of ethical hackers include 1) Risk assessment usually against known vulnerabilities/threats; 2) Discover unknown vulnerabilities/threats; and 3) Compliance with privacy and security regulations and standards--government regulations (e.g., Privacy Act, 1983; PIPEDA, 2000), industry regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, ISO/NIST), and in-house standard procedures and best practices.

**Risk assessment definition**

The NIST Risk Management Guide defines risk assessment as “the process of identifying the risks to system security and determining the probability of occurrence, the resulting impact, and additional safeguards that would mitigate this impact” (Landoll & Landoll, 2005, p. 10). A vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing (ranking) the vulnerabilities in a system. Vulnerability assessments can include passive and active vulnerability scanning of network and operating systems. Vulnerability assessments usually covers network and infrastructure testing.

**Penetration testing definition**

“A penetration test is,

a proactive and authorized attempt to evaluate the security of an IT infrastructure by safely attempting to exploit system vulnerabilities, including OS, service and application flaws, improper configurations, and even risky or illegal end-user behaviour. (Rodger, 2013, p. 41)

Tests are typically performed to systematically compromise servers, endpoints, web applications, wireless networks, network devices, mobile devices and other potential points of exposure. Testers may even attempt to use the compromised system to launch subsequent attacks at other internal resources, specifically by trying to incrementally achieve higher levels of security clearance and deeper access to electronic assets and information via privilege escalation. (Rodger, 2013, p. 41)

Table 15: Vulnerability Scan and Penetration Test Comparison

The “**magic**” part of a penetration test is exploiting a vulnerability discovered during the vulnerability assessment phase (Harper et al., 2011; Walker, 2017).

A penetration test “is when ethical hackers do their **magic**. They can test many of the vulnerabilities identified during the vulnerability assessment to quantify the actual threat and risk posed by the vulnerability” (Harper el al., 2011, p. 11). Penetration testing includes **probing** for vulnerabilities as well as giving proof of concept for an attack--that is, testing or verifying a hypothesis.&#x20;

Penetration testing is “usually done by a person or party contracted by the target to pinpoint any weaknesses that they may have.”&#x20;

The recommendations should tell the customer how to remediate the identified findings.

“You cannot prove that something is secure. You can only prove that you don’t know how to attack it.” (PPT10)
