# Who are ethical hackers

PhD thesis section: 4.2.4. An identity and legitimacy crisis.

**Historical account:**

• The role of the mass media and law enforcement in changing the original positive connotation of the term hacking from around the late 1980s and through the early 1990s to connote unlawful or criminal acts (Coleman & Golub, 2008; Thomas, 2005).

• Thomas (2005) traces the legacy of demonization of hackers to the rhetoric of media and law enforcement of the early 1990s. “In retrospect, the rhetoric of law enforcement and of other ‘moral entrepreneurs’ of the late 1980s and early 1990s can be seen as an example of how the symbolic manufacturing and pursuit of demons can lead to equally demonic excesses that may create ethical transgressions greater than those being controlled (p. 600).

• The pioneering historical work of Steven Levy (1984) on hacker culture and hacker ethic (Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution).

Levy (1984) offered one of the earliest theorizations of hacker ethic (what hackers thought it meant to be a hacker), particularly in the early decades of computer technology in the 1950s and 1960s (McConchie, 2015). Key hacker ethic principles are: 1) “The fundamental tenet of the hacker ethic is that information should be free, and that access to computers should be unrestricted” (McConchie, 2015, p. 879)...

**Anthropological analysis:**

A taxonomy of various hacker ethic based on idioms and practices (Coleman & Golub, 2008).

Coleman and Golub (2008) saw various hacker ethic as representative of the subjective self. In that vein, they conceptualize three liberal moral expressions of hackers and hacking (cultural sensibilities or hacker ethics) revealed variably in the context of computer hacking: Cryptofreedom, free and open source software, and the hacker underground.&#x20;

**Information security account (case study/personal experience):**

Palmer (2001) offers one of the most authoritative conceptions of who are ethical hackers from inside the information security field.
