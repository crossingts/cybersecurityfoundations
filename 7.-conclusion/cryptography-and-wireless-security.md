# Cryptography and wireless security

## Chapter 5: Cryptography and wireless security <a href="#chapter-5-wireless-security-and-cryptography" id="chapter-5-wireless-security-and-cryptography"></a>

Chapter 5 explored the critical security mechanisms that protect data in transit, focusing on two essential areas: cryptography for online communications and security for wireless networks. It detailed how cryptographic tools—symmetric encryption (AES), asymmetric encryption (RSA), and hashing (SHA-256)—are combined within the SSL/TLS protocol to provide confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, explaining processes like the TLS handshake and the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The chapter then applied these principles of authentication and encryption to the wireless domain, analyzing how the IEEE 802.11 standard forms a security framework and comparing the evolution of wireless security protocols (WPA, WPA2, WPA3) in safeguarding network access and data privacy.
