# Cybersecurity GRC

## Chapter 3: Cybersecurity GRC

The GRC approach establishes a continuous, closed-loop process for risk management. Governance provides the strategic mandate and framework for managing risk. This directive triggers the risk assessment phase, which systematically identifies security needs and priorities. Based on these findings, appropriate controls are selected and implemented as treatment measures. Security testing then serves the critical function of validating that these controls are operating effectively, with the empirical results feeding directly back into subsequent risk assessment cycles, ensuring the process adapts to a changing threat landscape.

Chapter 3 introduced **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** as the essential management framework for integrating cybersecurity with business strategy. It explained how organizations use GRC to systematically navigate **key regulations and standards** (such as GDPR and PCI DSS), align security with objectives, and fulfill legal obligations. The chapter detailed the core components of this approach: establishing **governance structures**, conducting **information security risk assessments** to identify and prioritize threats, and performing **compliance audits** to validate adherence to required controls. Overall, it presented GRC as the structured discipline that enables businesses to proactively manage cyber risk and demonstrate due diligence.
