# Cybersecurity GRC

## Chapter 3: Cybersecurity GRC

This chapter reviews how GRC frameworks align security with business goals. GRC frameworks such as NIST SP 800-37, NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), and ISO/IEC 27001 Information security management system (ISMS) help organizations align security with business goals by integrating strategic governance, risk management, and compliance into business operations.

The GRC approach establishes a continuous, closed-loop process for risk management. Governance provides the strategic mandate and framework for managing risk. This directive triggers the risk assessment phase, which systematically identifies security needs and priorities. Based on these findings, appropriate controls are selected and implemented as treatment measures. Security testing then serves the critical function of validating that these controls are operating effectively, with the empirical results feeding directly back into subsequent risk assessment cycles, ensuring the process adapts to a changing threat landscape.
