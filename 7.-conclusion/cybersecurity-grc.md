# Cybersecurity GRC

## Chapter 3: Cybersecurity GRC

Chapter 3 introduced Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) as the essential management framework for integrating cybersecurity with business strategy. It explained how organizations use GRC to systematically navigate key regulations and standards (such as GDPR and PCI DSS), align security with objectives, and fulfill legal obligations. The chapter detailed the core components of this approach: establishing governance structures, conducting information security risk assessments to identify and prioritize threats, and performing compliance audits to validate adherence to required controls. Overall, it presented GRC as the structured discipline that enables businesses to proactively manage cyber risk and demonstrate due diligence.
