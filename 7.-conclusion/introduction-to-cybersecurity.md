# Introduction to cybersecurity

## Chapter 2: Introduction to cybersecurity

Through an exploration of key concepts and practices, this chapter introduced students to the goals of cybersecurity and how it is defined and practiced within organizations.

### The goals of cybersecurity

At the most tactical level, the goal of cybersecurity is to protect the CIA of information assets. At the most strategic level, the goal of cybersecurity is to advance the strategic interests of the corporation. This involves creating value for stakeholders by aligning cybersecurity practices with the strategic goals of the corporation using QA paradigms/frameworks. 

### How cybersecurity is defined

Information security,

* is concerned with both the protection of information as well as the of technological infrastructure or information systems (Cherdantseva & Hilton, 2013; CNSS, 2010);
* is concerned with access to information (CNSS, 201; ISACA, 2008); and
* aims to provide assurance “that information risks and controls are in balance” (Anderson, J., 2003).

### How cybersecurity is practiced

Organizations take a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity. An organization's information security goals and how to achieve them are typically articulated in a policy document. Achieving the goals are typically understood in terms of compliance requirements.

**The chapter's opening section, Introduction to Cybersecurity**, established the core principles that anchor the field of cybersecurity. At its heart, information security is the risk management discipline dedicated to protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad) of information assets. These three imperatives—preventing unauthorized access, ensuring data is accurate and unaltered, and maintaining reliable access for authorized users—form the fundamental security objectives. Supporting these goals are essential operational frameworks like Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) for controlled access, and foundational concepts such as cryptography, which provides the technical means to achieve confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation.

Practically, organizations implement these concepts through a continuous cycle of risk management. This involves identifying assets, uncovering vulnerabilities, assessing potential threats, and deploying appropriate mitigations—which range from policies and technical controls like encryption and DDoS protection to user training. A key insight is that security is not about achieving perfect protection, but about reducing risk to an acceptable level through a balanced, prioritized investment in defenses. This risk-based approach ensures that security strategies are aligned with business objectives, acknowledging the necessary trade-off between robust security measures and the functional accessibility that enables an organization to operate and thrive.
