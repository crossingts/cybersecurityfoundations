## Chapter 2: Introduction to cybersecurity

Through an exploration of key concepts and practices, this chapter introduced students to the goals of cybersecurity and how it is defined and practiced within organizations.

This chapter introduced students to...

**The chapter's opening section, Foundational Cybersecurity Concepts**, established the core principles that anchor the entire field of cybersecurity. At its heart, information security is the risk management discipline dedicated to protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad) of information assets. These three imperatives—preventing unauthorized access, ensuring data is accurate and unaltered, and maintaining reliable access for authorized users—form the fundamental security objectives. Supporting these goals are essential operational frameworks like Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) for controlled access, and foundational concepts such as cryptography, which provides the technical means to achieve confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation.

Practically, organizations implement these concepts through a risk management approach. This involves identifying assets, uncovering vulnerabilities, assessing potential threats, and deploying appropriate mitigations—which range from policies and technical controls like encryption and DDoS protection to user training. A key insight is that security is not about achieving perfect protection, but about reducing risk to an acceptable level through a balanced, prioritized investment in defenses. This risk-based approach ensures that security strategies are aligned with business objectives, acknowledging the necessary trade-off between robust security measures and the functional accessibility that enables an organization to operate and thrive.

**The second section examined The cybersecurity threat landscape** as a complex and multi-layered environment. Threats operate across three primary levels:

- **Societal:** State-sponsored attacks target critical infrastructure like power grids and health services, while disinformation campaigns exploit social media to undermine public trust.
- **Individual:** Cybercrime such as identity theft and financial fraud is rampant, compounded by pervasive state and corporate surveillance that erodes personal privacy.
- **Business/Organizational:** Enterprises face cyber espionage for intellectual property theft, disruptive ransomware attacks, and sophisticated social engineering schemes like phishing that target human vulnerabilities.

These threats are being amplified and accelerated by powerful, interconnected drivers. Technological advances such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the convergence of digital systems exponentially expand the attack surface, while also providing adversaries with more potent tools. Concurrently, sociopolitical forces, most notably the U.S.-China strategic rivalry and the expansion of the digital military-industrial complex, fuel state-sponsored espionage, sabotage, and the global commercialization of offensive cyber capabilities. This creates a dangerous feedback loop: geopolitical tension escalates cyber conflict, which a growing private threat intelligence and spyware industry monetizes, leading to a more dynamic and perilous environment for all digital actors.
