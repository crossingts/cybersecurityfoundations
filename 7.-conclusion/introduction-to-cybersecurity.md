## Chapter 2: Introduction to cybersecurity

Through an exploration of key concepts and practices, this chapter introduced students to the goals of cybersecurity and how it is defined and practiced within organizations.

### The goals of cybersecurity

At the most tactical level, the goal of cybersecurity is to protect the CIA of information assets. At the most strategic level, the goal of cybersecurity is to advance the strategic interests of the corporation. This involves creating value for stakeholders by aligning cybersecurity practices with the strategic goals of the corporation using QA paradigms/frameworks. 

### How cybersecurity is defined

Information security,

* is concerned with both the protection of information as well as the of technological infrastructure or information systems (Cherdantseva & Hilton, 2013; CNSS, 2010);
* is concerned with access to information (CNSS, 201; ISACA, 2008); and
* aims to provide assurance “that information risks and controls are in balance” (Anderson, J., 2003).

### How cybersecurity is practiced

Organizations take a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity. An organization's information security goals and how to achieve them are typically articulated in a policy document. Achieving the goals are typically understood in terms of compliance requirements.
