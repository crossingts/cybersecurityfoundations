## Chapter 4: Networking fundamentals <a href="#chapter-4-networking-fundamentals" id="chapter-4-networking-fundamentals"></a>

Chapter 4 covered two main objectives. First, this chapter covered networking fundamentals by way of tracing the movement of a data packet from one host to another across the Internet - highlighting key network devices and network protocols involved, and data encapsulation/de-encapsulation against the OSI model layers. Second, this chapter established the practical groundwork for building and securing a network by teaching essential configuration skills, including static routes and ACLs. Finally, you learned to integrate critical services like DHCP, DNS, and NAT to provide a complete and functional network environment.

**The first section, Network Devices and Their Functions**, established the fundamental building blocks of computer networking. At its core, a network is a system for transporting data between **hosts**—any device, such as a **client** or **server**, identified by a unique **IP address**. These hosts are logically grouped into networks and subnets, which require specialized hardware to manage communication. The discussion traced the evolution of key **network devices**, from simple signal boosters like **repeaters** and broadcast-heavy **hubs**, to more intelligent **bridges** that filter traffic. Modern internal communication is primarily handled by **switches**, which efficiently direct data within a network by learning device addresses. Connectivity between different networks is the domain of **routers**, which use routing tables to intelligently forward traffic across the internet.

The arrangement of these devices creates a functional hierarchy: end hosts connect to switches, which aggregate local traffic and connect to routers that serve as gateways to other networks. **Firewalls**, whether network-based or host-based, provide critical security by monitoring and controlling this traffic according to defined rules. Together, these components form the essential infrastructure that enables all digital communication, from a simple local file transfer to global internet access. Understanding the distinct roles of switches (for intra-network switching) and routers (for inter-network routing) is key to grasping how data moves seamlessly across complex, interconnected systems.
