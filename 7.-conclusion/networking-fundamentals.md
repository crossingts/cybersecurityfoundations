Chapter 4 covered two main objectives. First, this chapter covered networking fundamentals by way of tracing the movement of a data packet from one host to another across the Internet - highlighting key network devices and network protocols involved, and data encapsulation/de-encapsulation against the OSI model layers. Second, this chapter established the practical groundwork for building and securing a network by teaching essential configuration skills, including static routes and ACLs. Finally, you learned to integrate critical services like DHCP, DNS, and NAT to provide a complete and functional network environment.
