# Networking fundamentals

## Chapter 4: Networking fundamentals <a href="#chapter-4-networking-fundamentals" id="chapter-4-networking-fundamentals"></a>

Chapter 4 provided the essential theoretical and practical foundation for understanding and operating modern networks. It demystified core concepts by explaining the function of **network devices**, the layered **OSI model**, and the **protocols** like TCP/IP and DNS that enable host-to-host communication, using the journey of a web request as a unifying example. Building on this theory, the chapter equipped students with hands-on skills for network management, including configuring **router operations and security**, implementing **static routes and ACLs**, and integrating critical services like **DHCP and NAT**. Throughout, it connected each network layer to potential security threats, establishing a crucial link between networking fundamentals and cybersecurity practice.

This chapter had two main goals. First, this chapter covered networking fundamentals by way of tracing the movement of a data packet from one host to another across the Internet - highlighting key network devices and network protocols involved, and data encapsulation/de-encapsulation against the OSI model layers. Second, this chapter established the practical groundwork for building and securing a network by teaching essential configuration skills, including static routes and ACLs. Finally, you learned to integrate critical services like DHCP, DNS, and NAT to provide a complete and functional network environment.
