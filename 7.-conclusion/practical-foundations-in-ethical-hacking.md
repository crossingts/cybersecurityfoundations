# Practical foundations in ethical hacking

## Chapter 6: Practical foundations in ethical hacking <a href="#chapter-6-practical-foundations-in-ethical-hacking" id="chapter-6-practical-foundations-in-ethical-hacking"></a>

Chapter 6 established ethical hacking as the authorized, professional practice of security verification, sharply contrasting it with unauthorized hacking. It detailed the structured penetration testing process—from planning and reconnaissance to reporting—and compared different testing types and methodologies (like black box vs. white box). The chapter also connected ethical hacking to the broader security ecosystem, covering defensive technologies (such as IDS/IPS and SIEM) that testers must understand, and outlined common attack targets and tools. Overall, it framed ethical hacking as a disciplined, risk-aware practice essential for identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening organizational defense.
