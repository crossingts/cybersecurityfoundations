# Practical foundations in ethical hacking

## Chapter 6: Practical foundations in ethical hacking <a href="#chapter-6-practical-foundations-in-ethical-hacking" id="chapter-6-practical-foundations-in-ethical-hacking"></a>

Chapter 6 established **ethical hacking** as the authorized, professional practice of security verification, sharply contrasting it with unauthorized hacking. It detailed the structured **penetration testing process**—from planning and reconnaissance to reporting—and compared different testing types and methodologies (like black box vs. white box). The chapter also connected ethical hacking to the broader security ecosystem, covering **defensive technologies** (such as IDS/IPS and SIEM) that testers must understand, and outlined common **attack targets and tools**. Overall, it framed ethical hacking as a disciplined, risk-aware practice essential for identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening organizational defense.

This chapter helps students develop a practical and professional understanding of who are ethical hackers and what they do.

This chapter frames penetration testing as professional ethical hacking, a process involving authorized/contractual vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and mitigation.

Most vulnerabilities exploited by penetration testing fall into the following categories: Misconfigurations (particularly, insecure default settings), kernel flaws, buffer overflows, insufficient input validation, symbolic links, file descriptors, race conditions, and incorrect file and directory permissions (NIST SP 800-115, 2008, pp. 5-4-5-5).

The professional ethics of ethical hackers are defined by legal compliance, contractual obligations, moral responsibility, and adherence to industry standards. Unlike grey or black hat hackers, ethical hackers must successfully navigate complex ethical and legal landscapes to preserve their professional and reputational standing. By following established frameworks and maintaining public trust, ethical hackers play a crucial role in defending digital systems against malicious threats.
