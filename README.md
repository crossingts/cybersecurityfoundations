# 🖌️ Practical Foundations in Cybersecurity

## Introduction

The global demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals has never been higher. This book covers key theoretical and practical foundations that have real-world relevance for those embarking on a career in cybersecurity, whether in defensive, offensive, or governance roles. To provide a clear benchmark for the reader, the technical content is written at the foundational level of industry-respected certifications, namely, the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) from EC-Council, and the CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) from ISC2. Further, this resource is designed to help learners looking to enter the cybersecurity field choose a specialization and plan their skill development journey. The main audience for this book is learners with little to no technical background and experience in IT and who want to break into a cybersecurity career.

## Learning Objectives

### Part 1: Foundational Cybersecurity (Chapters 1–3)

* Understand emerging cybersecurity job roles and relevant skills and industry certifications.
* Define core cybersecurity concepts, including the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) and key risk management concepts such as threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation.
* Understand the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape and its key technological and sociopolitical drivers.
* Describe common cyber attacks and malware types.
* Describe cybersecurity risk mitigation methods.
* Describe network security risk mitigation best practices.
* Explain how Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) frameworks (e.g., NIST SP 800-37, NIST CSF, and ISO/IEC 27001) can align cybersecurity with business goals.
* Identify key cybersecurity regulations (e.g., HIPAA and GDPR) and industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS).

### Part 2: Networking & Cryptography (Chapters 4–5)

* Explain how data flows across network layers (OSI/TCP/IP).
* Configure and verify fundamental router operations using the Cisco IOS CLI, including device security, IP addresses, static routes, and standard ACLs.
* Implement and integrate essential network services including DNS, DHCP, and Static NAT.
* Relate network layers (OSI/TCP/IP models) to vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques.
* Describe how SSL/TLS uses cryptography (symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing) to secure data in transit.
* Understand how the IEEE 802.11 standard provides a basis for a wireless security management framework (client authentication, message privacy, and message integrity).
* Become familiar with key authentication methods and encryption and message integrity algorithms used in securing wireless networks.
* Compare wireless security protocols (WPA/WPA2/WPA3) and their authentication and encryption methods.

### Part 3: Ethical Hacking (Chapters 6)

* Compare professional ethical hacking (white hat hacking), grey hat hacking, black hat hacking, and hacktivism.
* Become familiar with the professional ethics of ethical hackers.
* Become familiar with defensive security and offensive security approaches, including SIRT/CSIRT (Security Incident Response Team/Computer Security Incident Response Team), SOC (Security Operations Center), red teaming, and ethical hacking.
* Describe common defensive cybersecurity technologies such as packet analyzers (e.g., Wireshark and tcpdump), IDS/IPS (e.g., Suricata and Snort), network security monitoring/SIEM (e.g., Wazuh), and host/network firewalls (e.g., OPNsense, pfilter, and nftables).
* Describe the phases of the penetration testing process: planning, reconnaissance, scanning and enumeration, exploitation (gaining access), post-exploitation (privilege escalation, maintaining access, and covering tracks), and reporting.
* Become familiar with key penetration testing methodologies (e.g., OSSTMM, NIST SP 800-115, ISSAF, and PTES), frameworks (e.g., OWASP Testing Guide and MITRE ATT\&CK/cyber kill chain), and technologies (e.g., Nmap, OpenVAS, Metasploit, and Burp Suite).
* Identify common attack targets, including OS vulnerabilities, misconfigurations and default credentials, and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi).
